I would like to thank the following people for the successful completion of my thesis.

Main supervisor, Robert Williamson, who used his knowledge in the fields of risk measure and philosophy to give valuable guidance for me. The weekly meetings were vital for keeping me afloat in an unfamiliar ocean of knowledge.

Co-supervisor, Markus Hegland, who, while I have not met for many times, gave good feedback during the writing phase of my thesis.

My parents, who gave unwavering material support.

Best friends, Artline, Ira, and Lurid, who kept me alive during the years.

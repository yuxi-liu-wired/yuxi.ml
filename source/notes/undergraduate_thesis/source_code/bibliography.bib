  shorttitle = {The World until Yesterday},
  abstract = {Most of us take for granted the features of our modern society, from air travel and telecommunications to literacy and obesity. Yet for nearly all of its six million years of existence, human society had none of these things. While the gulf that divides us from our primitive ancestors may seem unbridgeably wide, we can glimpse much of our former lifestyle in those largely traditional societies still or recently in existence. Societies like those of the New Guinea Highlanders remind us that it was only yesterday—in evolutionary time—when everything changed and that we moderns still possess bodies and social practices often better adapted to traditional than to modern conditions.The World Until Yesterday provides a mesmerizing firsthand picture of the human past as it had been for millions of years—a past that has mostly vanished—and considers what the differences between that past and our present mean for our lives today.

This is Jared Diamond’s most personal book to date, as he draws extensively from his decades of field work in the Pacific islands, as well as evidence from Inuit, Amazonian Indians, Kalahari San people, and others. Diamond doesn’t romanticize traditional societies—after all, we are shocked by some of their practices—but he finds that their solutions to universal human problems such as child rearing, elder care, dispute resolution, risk, and physical fitness have much to teach us. Provocative, enlightening, and entertaining, The World Until Yesterday is an essential and fascinating read.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the Entropic Value-at-Risk (EV@R), a recently introduced coherent risk measure. It is demonstrated that the norms induced by EV@R induce the same Banach spaces, irrespective of the conﬁdence level. Three spaces, called the primal, dual, and bidual entropic spaces, corresponding with EV@R are fully studied. It is shown that these spaces equipped with the norms induced by EV@R are Banach spaces. The entropic spaces are then related to the Lp spaces, as well as speciﬁc Orlicz hearts and Orlicz spaces. This analysis indicates that the primal and bidual entropic spaces can be used as very ﬂexible model spaces, larger than L∞, over which all Lp-based risk measures are well-deﬁned. The dual EV@R norm and corresponding Hahn–Banach functionals are presented explicitly, which are not explicitly known for the Orlicz and Luxemburg norms that are equivalent to the EV@R norm. The duality relationships among the entropic spaces are investigated. The duality results are also used to develop an extended Donsker–Varadhan variational formula, and to explicitly provide the dual and Kusuoka representations of EV@R, as well as the corresponding maximizing densities in both representations.},

However, the applicability of these results is limited by the fact that such representations do not always exist in probability spaces with atoms, such as finite probability spaces. We introduce the class of functionally coherent risk measures, which allow us to use Kusuoka representations in any probability space. We show that this class contains every law invariant risk measure that can be coherently extended to a family containing all finite discrete distributions. Thus, it is possible to preserve the desirable properties of law invariant coherent risk measures on atomless spaces without sacrificing generality. We also specialize our results to risk measures on finite probability spaces, and prove a denseness result about the family of risk measures with finite Kusuoka representations.},

In this paper we introduce a new algorithm, UCT, that applies bandit ideas to guide Monte-Carlo planning. In finite-horizon or discounted MDPs the algorithm is shown to be consistent and finite sample bounds are derived on the estimation error due to sampling. Experimental results show that in several domains, UCT is significantly more efficient than its alternatives. 1},

  abstract = {Existing group fairness measures for data analytics are defined via independence of the predictor and a sensitive variable. The extension of such measures to multi-valued or continuous-valued sensitive variables, multiple different sensitive variables, or dealing with sensitive variables that are known only via probabilities is problematic. The present paper elucidates the source of such difficulties, and proposes a radically different approach to the measurement and optimisation of fairness, which easily deals with all of these cases, as well as providing a natural interpolation between group and individual fairness. The key idea is to reason fully decision-theoretically, and define perfect fairness only in terms of the loss, and associated risks of predictors, rather than in terms of the predictors themselves. The framework controls fairness by controlling deviation of predictive performance across sensitive attributes. It leads to optimisation problems no more difficult than the fairness-insensitive minimisation of expected risk, and it shows how to interpolate between, and thus reconcile, the different approaches to justice and fairness of Rawls and Harsanyi.},

  abstract = {We must often make decisions under conditions of uncertainty.Pursuing a degree in biology may lead to lucrative employment, or tounemployment and crushing debt. A doctor's appointment may result inthe early detection and treatment of a disease, or it may be a wasteof money. Expected utility theory is an account of how to chooserationally when you are not sure which outcome will result from youracts. Its basic slogan is: choose the act with the highest expectedutility., This article discusses expected utility theory as a normativetheory—that is, a theory of how people should makedecisions. In classical economics, expected utility theory is oftenused as a descriptive theory—that is, a theory of howpeople do make decisions—or as a predictivetheory—that is, a theory that, while it may not accurately modelthe psychological mechanisms of decision-making, correctly predictspeople's choices. Expected utility theory makes faulty predictionsabout people's decisions in many real-life choice situations (seeKahneman \& Tversky 1982); however, this does not settle whetherpeople should make decisions on the basis of expected utilityconsiderations., The expected utility of an act is a weighted average of theutilities of each of its possible outcomes, where the utilityof an outcome measures the extent to which that outcome is preferred,or preferable, to the alternatives. The utility of each outcome isweighted according to the probability that the act will lead to thatoutcome. Section 1 fleshes out this basic definition of expectedutility in more rigorous terms, and discusses its relationship tochoice. Section 2 discusses two types of arguments for expectedutility theory: representation theorems, and long-run statisticalarguments. Section 3 considers objections to expected utilitytheory; section 4 discusses its applications in philosophy ofreligion, economics, ethics, and epistemology.},

  abstract = {Machine learning addresses the question of how to build computers that improve automatically through experience. It is one of today’s most rapidly growing technical fields, lying at the intersection of computer science and statistics, and at the core of artificial intelligence and data science. Recent progress in machine learning has been driven both by the development of new learning algorithms and theory and by the ongoing explosion in the availability of online data and low-cost computation. The adoption of data-intensive machine-learning methods can be found throughout science, technology and commerce, leading to more evidence-based decision-making across many walks of life, including health care, manufacturing, education, financial modeling, policing, and marketing.},

@article{williamsonFairnessRiskMeasures2019a,
  title = {Fairness Risk Measures},
  abstract = {Ensuring that classifiers are non-discriminatory or fair with respect to a sensitive feature (e.g., race or gender) is a topical problem. Progress in this task requires fixing a definition of fairness, and there have been several proposals in this regard over the past few years. Several of these, however, assume either binary sensitive features (thus precluding categorical or real-valued sensitive groups), or result in non-convex objectives (thus adversely affecting the optimisation landscape). 
In this paper, we propose a new definition of fairness that generalises some existing proposals, while allowing for generic sensitive features and resulting in a convex objective. The key idea is to enforce that the expected losses (or risks) across each subgroup induced by the sensitive feature are commensurate. We show how this relates to the rich literature on risk measures from mathematical finance. As a special case, this leads to a new convex fairness-aware objective based on minimising the conditional value at risk (CVaR).},

        "During the 1950s and 1960s, the connectionist and symbolic schools of artificial intelligence competed for researcher allegiance and funding, with the symbolic school winning by 1970. This \"first neural network winter\" lasted until the rise of the connectionist school in the 1980s.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is often stated that neural networks were killed off by the 1969 publication of *Perceptrons* by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert. This story is wrong on multiple accounts:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Minsky and Papert had been working towards killing off neural networks since around 1965 by speaking at conferences and circulating preprints.\n",
        "* The mathematical content studies only the behavior of a single perceptron. It does not study multilayer perceptrons.\n",
        "* By 1969, most researchers had already left connectionism, frustrated by the lack of progress, as they did not develop backpropagation or deep learning. The last holdout, Frank Rosenblatt, died in 1971.\n",
        "\n",
        "The book achieved its mythical status as the \"neural network killer\" by its opportune timing, appearing just as the symbolic school achieved dominance. Since the connectionist school was almost empty, it faced little objection at its publication, creating the illusion that it caused the closure of the perceptron controversy.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the 1980s, the perceptron controversy reopened with the rise of connectionism. This time the controversy was bypassed without closure. Connectionists demonstrated that backpropagation with MLP bypassed most of the objections from *Perceptrons*. Minsky and Papert objected that the *lessons* of *Perceptrons* still applied, but their objections and lessons had by then become irrelevant.\n",
        "\n",
        "Minsky and Papert were possibly the most consistent critics of the scaling hypothesis, arguing over decades that neural networks cannot scale beyond mere toy problems. Minsky was motivated by mathematical certainty, as backpropagation--MLP cannot provably find global optima or accomplish any task efficiently, unlike a single perceptron. He rejected all experimental data with large MLP as theory-less data that cannot be extrapolated. Papert was motivated by social justice and epistemological equality. He rejected all scalable uniform architectures, like backpropagation--MLP, as threats to his vision of a society with different but equally valid ways of knowing.\n",
        "\n",
        "As of 2019, essentially all predictions by Minsky and Papert, concerning the non-scalability of neural networks, had been disproven.\n",

        "\n",
        "In a 1993 interview, [Robert Hecht-Nielsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hecht-Nielsen) recounted an encounter between [Marvin Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky) and the neural network community in the late 1980s[^minsky-not-the-devil]:\n",
        "\n",
        "> Minsky had gone to the same New York \"science\" high school as Frank Rosenblatt, a Cornell psychology Ph.D. whose \"perceptron\" neural network pattern recognition machine was receiving significant media attention. The wall-to-wall media coverage of Rosenblatt and his machine irked Minsky. One reason was that although Rosenblatt's training was in \"soft science,\" his perceptron work was quite mathematical and quite sound—turf that Minsky, with his \"hard science\" Princeton mathematics Ph.D., didn't feel Rosenblatt belonged on. Perhaps an even greater problem was the fact that the heart of the perceptron machine was a clever motor-driven potentiometer adaptive element that had been pioneered in the world's first neurocomputer, the \"SNARC\", which had been designed and built by Minsky several years earlier! In some ways, Minsky's early career was like that of Darth Vader. He started out as one of the earliest pioneers in neural networks but was then turned to the dark side of the force (AI) and became the strongest and most effective foe of his original community. This view of his career history is not unknown to him. When he was invited to give the keynote address at a large neural network conference in the late 1980s to an absolutely rapt audience, he began with the words: \"I am not the Devil!\" [@rosenfeldTalkingNetsOral2000, pages 303-305]\n",
        "\n",
        "[^minsky-not-the-devil]:\n",
        "    This was corroborated by a contemporary news report on the International Conference on Neural Networks of 1988:\n",
        "\n",
        "    > Minsky who has been criticized by many for the conclusions he and Papert make in 'Perceptrons,' opened his defense with the line 'Everybody seems to think I'm the devil.' Then he made the statement, 'I was wrong about Dreyfus too, but I haven't admitted it yet,' which brought another round of applause. (quoted in [@olazaranHistoricalSociologyNeural1991, page 285])\n",
        "\n",
        "However, it appears that he had changed his mind later. As recounted by [Terry Sejnowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Sejnowski):\n",
        "\n",
        "> I was invited to attend the 2006 Dartmouth Artificial Intelligence Conference, \"AI\\@50,\" a look back at the seminal 1956 Summer Research Project on artificial intelligence held at Dartmouth and a look forward to the future of artificial intelligence. ... These success stories had a common trajectory. In the past, computers were slow and only able to explore toy models with just a few parameters. But these toy models generalized poorly to real-world data. When abundant data were available and computers were much faster, it became possible to create more complex statistical models and to extract more features and relationships between the features.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> In his summary talk at the end of the conference, Marvin Minsky started out by saying how disappointed he was both by the talks and by where AI was going. He explained why: \"You're not working on the problem of general intelligence. You're just working on applications.\" ...\n",
        ">\n",
        "> There was a banquet on the last day of AI\\@50. At the end of the dinner, the five returning members of the 1956 Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence made brief remarks about the conference and the future of AI. In the question and answer period, I stood up and, turning to Minsky, said: \"There is a belief in the neural network community that you are the devil who was responsible for the neural network winter in the 1970s. Are you the devil?\" Minsky launched into a tirade about how we didn't understand the mathematical limitations of our networks. I interrupted him—\"Dr. Minsky, I asked you a yes or no question. Are you, or are you not, the devil?\" He hesitated for a moment, then shouted out, \"Yes, I am the devil!\" [@sejnowskiDeepLearningRevolution2018, pages 256--258]\n",

        "During his undergraduate years, Minsky was deeply impressed by [Andrew Gleason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_M._Gleason),[^andrew-gleason] and decided to work on pure mathematics, resulting in his 1951 undergraduate thesis *A Generalization of Kakutani's Fixed-Point Theorem*, which extended an obscure fixed-point theorem of [Kakutani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shizuo_Kakutani) -- not [the famous version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakutani_fixed-point_theorem), as Kakutani proved more than one fixed-point theorem.\n",

Our conversation must have taken place in 1947, when I was a sophomore. Well, the solution took him only about five more years ... Gleason made me realize for the first time that mathematics was a landscape with discernible canyons and mountain passes, and things like that. In high school, I had seen mathematics simply as a bunch of skills that were fun to master -- but I had never thought of it as a journey and a universe to explore. No one else I knew at that time had that vision, either. [@bernsteinMarvinMinskyVision1981]\n",

        "> I wrote it up and gave it to Gleason. He read it and said, ‘You are a mathematician.' Later, I showed the proof to Freeman Dyson, at the Institute for Advanced Study, and he amazed me with a proof [@dysonContinuousFunctionsDefined1951] that there must be at least one square that has the same temperature at all four vertices. He had found somewhere in my proof a final remnant of unused logic. [@bernsteinMarvinMinskyVision1981]\n",

        "He then became interested in neural networks and reinforcement learning, and constructed a very simple electromechanical machine called SNARC.[^snarc] The SNARC machine is a recurrent neural network that performs reinforcement learning by the Hebbian learning rule. It simulates a mouse running around a maze, while the operator watches an indicator light showing the mouse. The operator can press a button as a reward signal, which would cause an electric motor to turn a chain. The chain is clutched to rheostats that connect the neurons, with the stretch of the clutch being proportional to the charge in a capacitor. During the operation of the neural network, the capacitor charges up if there is neural co-activation on the connection, and decays naturally, thus serving as a short-term memory. When the reward button is pressed, the clutches turn by an amount proportional to the co-activation of neural connections, thereby completing the Hebbian learning.\n",

Even today, I still get letters from young students who say, ‘Why are you people trying to program intelligence? Why don't you try to find a way to build a nervous system that will just spontaneously create it?' Finally, I decided that either this was a bad idea or it would take thousands or millions of neurons to make it work, and I couldn't afford to try to build a machine like that.

        "\n",
        "> Minsky's doctoral dissertation in mathematics from Princeton in 1954 was a theoretical and experimental study of computing with neural networks. He had even built small networks from electronic parts to see how they behaved. The story I heard when I was a graduate student at Princeton in physics was that there wasn't anyone in the Mathematics Department who was qualified to assess his dissertation, so they sent it to the mathematicians at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton who, it was said, talked to God. The reply that came back was, \"If this isn't mathematics today, someday it will be,\" which was good enough to earn Minsky his PhD. [@sejnowskiDeepLearningRevolution2018, page 259]\n",

I once heard a story that the principal investigator forgot to ask for money in the grant proposal to build a vision system for the robot, so he assigned the problem to a graduate student as a summer project. I once asked Marvin Minsky whether the story was true. He snapped back that I had it wrong: \"We assigned the problem to undergraduate students.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "After rejecting neural networks, Minsky became a leading researcher in AI. His style of AI is typically described as \"symbolic AI\", although a more accurate description would be *The Society of Mind* (SoM). Minsky developed the SoM in the 1960s and 1970s with his long-time collaborator, [Seymour Papert](#sec-seymour-papert), inspired by their difficulty with building robots, and published the definitive account in [@minskySocietyMind1988].

        "> Both my collaborator, Seymour Papert, and I had long desired to combine a mechanical hand, a television eye, and a computer into a robot that could build with children's building-blocks. It took several years for us and our students to develop Move, See, Grasp, and hundreds of other little programs we needed to make a working Builder-agency. I like to think that this project gave us glimpses of what happens inside certain parts of children's minds when they learn to \"play\" with simple toys. The project left us wondering if even a thousand microskills would be enough to enable a child to fill a pail with sand. It was this body of experience, more than anything we'd learned about psychology, that led us to many ideas about societies of mind.\n",

        "> To do those first experiments, we had to build a mechanical Hand, equipped with sensors for pressure and touch at its fingertips. Then we had to interface a television camera with our computer and write programs with which that Eye could discern the edges of the building-blocks. It also had to recognize the Hand itself. When those programs didn't work so well, we added more programs that used the fingers' feeling-sense to verify that things were where they visually seemed to be. Yet other programs were needed to enable the computer to move the Hand from place to place while using the Eye to see that there was nothing in its way. We also had to write higher-level programs that the robot could use for planning what to do—and still more programs to make sure that those plans were actually carried out. To make this all work reliably, we needed programs to verify at every step (again by using Eye and Hand) that what had been planned inside the mind did actually take place outside—or else to correct the mistakes that occurred. ... Thousands and, perhaps, millions of little processes must be involved in how we anticipate, imagine, plan, predict, and prevent—and yet all this proceeds so automatically that we regard it as \"ordinary common sense.\" [@minskySocietyMind1988, Section 2.5]\n",

They cannot be mere perceptrons in a uniform block of neural network, or mere logic gates in a uniform block of CPU.\n",

        "In 1958, after earning a doctorate in mathematics, he met [Jean Piaget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Piaget) and became his pupil for four years.

Piaget's work was an important influence on the [constructivism philosophy in education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education)), and Papert would go on to bring constructivism from books to classrooms. He was particularly hopeful that computers can realize the constructivist dream of unlocking the kaleidoscopic creativity that a child can construct.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main theme of Jean Piaget's work was developmental psychology -- how children's understanding of the world changes as they grow up. What goes on in their mind as they progressively understand that things fall down, what dogs are, and that solid steel sinks but hollow steel might float? Piaget discovered that children did not simply start with a blank sheet of paper and gradually fill in sketchy details of the true model. Instead they constructed little models of small facets of reality that would be modified or completely replaced as they encounter new phenomena that their old models cannot explain. In this way, Piaget claimed that children are \"little scientists\".\n",
        "\n",
        "A small example illustrates the idea. When children see that a leaf floats on water, but a stone sinks, they add a rule \"Soft things float, while hard things sink.\". Then, they see that a hard plastic boat floats too, so they add a rule \"Except hard and light things also float.\". Then, they see that a large boat also floats, so they rewrite the entire model to \"Flat-bottomed things float, while small-bottomed things sink.\". And so on.\n",

The conservative approach involves studying how children construct their scientific theories and identifying a sequence of evidence to present to these young scientists so they can quickly reach scientific orthodoxy. For example, we might show children videos of curling and air hockey, then let them play with an air hockey table, following this with guided exercises, so they race through [animism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animism), [Aristotelian physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelian_physics), [impetus theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_impetus), etc, and end up with Newton's laws of motion.\n",

In the computer world, every child could program and construct \"microworlds\" from their own theories. Thus, computers would bring constructivism to the classroom. Furthermore, the constructed world inside computers could then flow out to the physical world via robots. This is why Papert worked on both *Logo* the programming language and *Logo* the turtle robots. In his words, he intended to fight \"instructionism\" with \"constructionism\" by bringing the power of the computer to every child, so that they would grow up to be \"[bricoleurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Savage_Mind)\", working with whatever little tool they have available doing whatever is necessary to accomplish little things.

Faced with a job, the tinker rummages in his bag of assorted tools to find one that will fit the problem at hand and, if one tool does nor work for the job, simply tries another without ever being upset in the slightest by the lack of generality. The basic tenets of bricolage as a methodology for intellectual activity are: Use what you've got, improvise, make do. And for the true bricoleur, the tools in the bag will have been selected over a long time by a process determined by more than pragmatic utility. These mental tools will be as well worn and comfortable as the physical tools of the traveling tinker; they will give a sense of the familiar, of being at ease with oneself ...\n",

In the traditional usage, the goal of epistemology is to inquire into the nature of knowledge and the conditions of its validity; and only one form of knowledge, the propositional, is taken to be valid. The step taken by Piaget in his definition of *epistemologie genetique* was to eschew inquiry into the \"true\" nature of knowledge in favor of a comparative study of the diverse nature of different kinds of knowledge, in his case the kinds encountered in children of different ages. We differ from Piaget on an important point, however.

Other problems were excessive learning time, excessive dependence on external evaluation (supervision), and lack of ability to separate essential parts in a complex environment. Rosenblatt (1962, pp. 309-310) included the 'figure-ground' or 'connectedness' problem in this last point.\n",

The previous questions [from the first to the twelfth] are all in the nature of 'mopping-up' operations in areas where some degree of performance is known to be possible . . .

They did two things. First, Minsky and Papert began work on a manuscript designed to discredit neural network research.

When I first heard the story, I immediately saw why XOR was unsolvable by one perceptron, then took a few minutes to design a two-layered perceptron network that solved the XOR problem.

This put a severe strain on the operator of the AA guns. Wiener constructed electromechanical devices that performed linear prediction of the future trajectory of an aircraft based on its past trajectory.

The authors wrote that the distinctive feature of the human faculty of language, narrowly defined, is recursion. Dogs, starlings, whales, porpoises, and chimpanzees all use vocally generated sounds to communicate with other members of their species, but none do so recursively, and thus none can produce complex utterances of infinitely varied meaning. \"Recursion had always been an important part of Chomsky's theory,\" Pinker said. \"But in Chomsky Mark II, or Mark III, or Mark VII, he all of a sudden said that the only thing unique to language is recursion. It's not just that it's the universal that has to be there; it's the magic ingredient that makes language possible.\" [@colapintoInterpreter2007]\n",

        "A key principle Chomsky used was the \"poverty of stimulus\" argument, which he used to argue that humans must have a universal grammar built in at birth, because children cannot possibly learn to speak when they are just a few years old -- they cannot possibly have heard and seen enough. For one thing, true recursion can never be learned empirically, because true recursion can only be conclusively proven by observing an infinite number of sentences.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider the simple example of the [balanced brackets language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyck_language). A language learner observes sample sentences from the language and tries to infer the language. Suppose the learner sees a sequence `(), (()), ((())), (((())))`. What can they conclude? That it is the balanced brackets language? So we ask them to construct another sentence, and they confidently write `((((()))))`, but then we inform them that they have been tricked! The language is the balanced brackets language -- except that the brackets only go 4 levels deep. In general, only by seeing all levels of recursion can the balanced brackets language be *conclusively* learned.\n",

        "> Just to illustrate, I'll take one example that was presented back in the 1950s and has become a sort of a classic case because it's so trivial. 'Can eagles that fly swim?' Okay, simple sentence. Everyone understands it. Any young child understands it. There is a question about it. We know that we associate the word 'can' with 'swim,' not with 'fly.' We're asking 'Can they swim?' We're not asking 'Can they fly?' Well, why is that? A natural answer ought to be that you associate 'can' with 'fly.' After all, 'fly' is the word that's closest to 'can,' so why don't you just take the closest word and interpret it that way? ... Well, that property is universal. It holds up in every language. Languages may do it differently, but they're going to have the same property. It holds in every construction anyone knows, and it's just a universal property of language.\n",

There's been a huge effort to show that it's not a problem, that if you just do a complex statistical analysis of complex data, you'll find that that's what the child will determine from the data. The approaches are odd in several respects. First, every one is not only a failure but a colossal failure. I'm not going to talk about that. I actually have a recent paper about it with a computer scientist at MIT, Bob Berwick, where we run through a lot of the current proposals but it's easy to show that they're all just wildly wrong. But they keep coming. Almost every issue of the main cognitive science journals has another proposal of this sort, so that's one odd fact.

  abstract = {In recent years, the effect of the curse of high dimensionality has been studied in great detail on several problems such as clustering, nearest neighbor search, and indexing. In high dimensional space the data becomes sparse, and traditional indexing and algorithmic techniques fail from a effciency and/or effectiveness perspective. Recent research results show that in high dimensional space, the concept of proximity, distance or nearest neighbor may not even be qualitatively meaningful. In this paper, we view the dimensionality curse from the point of view of the distance metrics which are used to measure the similarity between objects. We specifically examine the behavior of the commonly used Lknorm and show that the problem of meaningfulness in high dimensionality is sensitive to the value of k. For example, this means that the Manhattan distance metric L(1norm) is consistently more preferable than the Euclidean distance metric L(2norm) for high dimensional data mining applications. Using the intuition derived from our analysis, we introduce and examine a natural extension of the Lknorm to fractional distance metrics. We show that the fractional distance metric provides more meaningful results both from the theoretical and empirical perspective. The results show that fractional distance metrics can significantly improve the effectiveness of standard clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm.},

We have attempted to give an account sufficiently in depth to convey the general picture, as well as to indicate the mutual relationships between various methods, their relative successes and shortcomings, mentioning also open problems in the area. Finally, even for approaches for which lack of space or expertise prevented us from treating them to the extent they would deserve, we have tried to provide ample references to the existing literature on the subject. In all cases, we have made an effort to keep the discussion accessible both to physicists and to mathematicians, including non-specialists in the field.},

Possible and partial reasons include business management approaches, company revenue models, the lack of expert systems standards, and the complexity of expert systems solutions. The discussion also continues to explore how AI and expert systems technologies have evolved and been absorbed into existing products and services. Examples include rule-based systems, enterprise search, business rules, and knowledge-based systems.},

Moreover, they provide a unifying language for discussing and comparing the variety of theories of liquids that have been proposed; for example, many integral equations such as the Percus---Yevick equation(5) and the mean spherical model equation(6-8) for the pair correlation function of a fluid can be regarded as devices for summing certain diagrams in a cluster series.},

(3) After a sufficiently long time (related to the initial spatial spread) the wave function converges to a simple form that is simply related to the momentum distribution of the packet. In this asymptotic regime the shape of the probability distribution no longer changes, and its scale increases linearly with the time.

  abstract = {Diffusion language models offer unique benefits over autoregressive models due to their potential for parallelized generation and controllability, yet they lag in likelihood modeling and are limited to fixed-length generation. In this work, we introduce a class of block diffusion language models that interpolate between discrete denoising diffusion and autoregressive models. Block diffusion overcomes key limitations of both approaches by supporting flexible-length generation and improving inference efficiency with KV caching and parallel token sampling. We propose a recipe for building effective block diffusion models that includes an efficient training algorithm, estimators of gradient variance, and data-driven noise schedules to minimize the variance. Block diffusion sets a new state-of-the-art performance among diffusion models on language modeling benchmarks and enables generation of arbitrary-length sequences. We provide the code, along with the model weights and blog post on the project page: https://m-arriola.com/bd3lms/},

  abstract = {Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) [Ho et al. 2021] have shown impressive results on image and waveform generation in continuous state spaces. Here, we introduce Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (D3PMs), diffusion-like generative models for discrete data that generalize the multinomial diffusion model of Hoogeboom et al. [2021], by going beyond corruption processes with uniform transition probabilities. This includes corruption with transition matrices that mimic Gaussian kernels in continuous space, matrices based on nearest neighbors in embedding space, and matrices that introduce absorbing states. The third allows us to draw a connection between diffusion models and autoregressive and mask-based generative models. We show that the choice of transition matrix is an important design decision that leads to improved results in image and text domains. We also introduce a new loss function that combines the variational lower bound with an auxiliary cross entropy loss.  For text, this model class achieves strong results on character-level text generation while scaling to large vocabularies on LM1B. On the image dataset CIFAR-10, our models approach the sample quality and exceed the log-likelihood of the continuous-space DDPM model.},

  abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

It is demonstrated here through textual analysis that Engels criticized not the entropy law itself but the extrapolation of this into the ``heat death theory of the universe'' hypothesis. The historical debate surrounding this hypothesis is examined, showing that Engels and Marx remained consistent with the natural science of their day. This opens the way to the recognition that Marx's political economy was unique in the 19th century in incorporating thermodynamics into the core of its analysis, thus providing the foundations for an ecological economics. The materialist-dialectical view of classical Marxism led to a dynamic, open, contingent approach to the earth system, reflecting a general evolutionary perspective.},

  abstract = {The principal message of this book is that thermodynamics and statistical mechanics will benefit from replacing the unfortunate, misleading and mysterious term "entropy" with a more familiar, meaningful and appropriate term such as information, missing information or uncertainty. This replacement would facilitate the interpretation of the "driving force" of many processes in terms of informational changes and dispel the mystery that has always enshrouded entropy.It has been 140 years since Clausius coined the term "entropy"; almost 50 years since Shannon developed the mathematical theory of "information" -- subsequently renamed "entropy". In this book, the author advocates replacing "entropy" by "information", a term that has become widely used in many branches of science.The author also takes a new and bold approach to thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Information is used not only as a tool for predicting distributions but as the fundamental cornerstone concept of thermodynamics, held until now by the term "entropy".The topics covered include the fundamentals of probability and information theory; the general concept of information as well as the particular concept of information as applied in thermodynamics; the re-derivation of the Sackur-Tetrode equation for the entropy of an ideal gas from purely informational arguments; the fundamental formalism of statistical mechanics; and many examples of simple processes the "driving force" for which is analyzed in terms of information.},

Each motor drives a long, thin, helical filament that extends several cell body lengths out into the external medium. The assemblage of motor and filament is called a flagellum. The concerted motion of several flagella enables a cell to swim. A cell can move toward regions that it deems more favorable by measuring changes in the concentrations of certain chemicals in its environment (mostly nutrients), deciding whether life is getting better or worse, and then modulating the direction of rotation of its flagella. Thus, in addition to rotary engines and propellers, E. coli's standard accessories include particle counters, rate meters, and gear boxes. This microorganism is a nanotechnologist's dream. I will discuss the features that make it so, from the perspectives of several scientific disciplines: anatomy, genetics, chemistry, and physics.},

  abstract = {Statistical fluctuations limit the precision with which a microorganism can, in a given time T, determine the concentration of a chemoattractant in the surrounding medium. The best a cell can do is to monitor continually the state of occupation of receptors distributed over its surface. For nearly optimum performance only a small fraction of the surface need be specifically adsorbing. The probability that a molecule that has collided with the cell will find a receptor is Ns/(Ns + pi a), if N receptors, each with a binding site of radius s, are evenly distributed over a cell of radius a. There is ample room for many indenpendent systems of specific receptors. The adsorption rate for molecules of moderate size cannot be significantly enhanced by motion of the cell or by stirring of the medium by the cell. The least fractional error attainable in the determination of a concentration c is approximately (TcaD) - 1/2, where D is diffusion constant of the attractant. The number of specific receptors needed to attain such precision is about a/s. Data on bacteriophage absorption, bacterial chemotaxis, and chemotaxis in a cellular slime mold are evaluated. The chemotactic sensitivity of Escherichia coli approaches that of the cell of optimum design.},

Thematically organized, Cognitive Science underscores the problems and solutions of cognitive science rather than more narrowly examining individually the subjects that contribute to it - psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, and so on. The generous use of examples, illustrations, and applications demonstrates how theory is applied to unlock the mysteries of the human mind. Drawing upon cutting-edge research, the text has been substantially revised, with new material on Bayesian approaches to the mind and on deep learning. An extensive on-line set of resources is available to aid instructors and students alike. Sample syllabi show how the text can support a variety of courses, making it a highly flexible teaching and learning resource at both the undergraduate and graduate levels},

  abstract = {This chapter describes how the current understanding of conical refraction has been acquired after nearly two centuries of theoretical and experimental studies. A systematic use of the simplifying approximation of paraxiality is made in the chapter. This is justified by the small angles involved in conical diffraction. Conical diffraction exemplifies a fundamental feature of crystal optics----namely, the diabolical point. Belsky and Khapalyuk's exact paraxial theory of conical diffraction is explored in the chapter with an emphasis on pinhole and Gaussian beams. The chapter focuses on chiral and biaxially birefringent materials. Chirality has been found to destroy the diabolical point by separating the two sheets of the wave surface, reflecting the change of the dielectric matrix from real symmetric to complex Hermitian. The chapter demonstrates that each diabolical point splits into two branch-points, reflecting the fact that the dielectric matrix is non-Hermitian. The effects of absorption on the pattern of emerging light, as well as the combined effects of dichroism and chirality, are described.}

  abstract = {The effects of noise on the world, and on our views of the world, are profound. Noise in the sense of a large number of small events is often a causal factor much more powerful than a small number of large events can be. Noise makes trading in financial markets possible, and thus allows us to observe prices for financial assets. Noise causes markets to be somewhat inefficient, but often prevents us from taking advantage of inefficiencies. Noise in the form of uncertainty about future tastes and technology by sector causes business cycles, and makes them highly resistant to improvement through government intervention. Noise in the form of expectations that need not follow rational rules causes inflation to be what it is, at least in the absence of a gold standard or fixed exchange rates. Noise in the form of uncertainty about what relative prices would be with other exchange rates makes us think incorrectly that changes in exchange rates or inflation rates cause changes in trade or investment flows or economic activity. Most generally, noise makes it very difficult to test either practical or academic theories about the way that financial or economic markets work. We are forced to act largely in the dark.},

However, they are not well suited for implementation on serial computers. In this paper, we discuss the first implementation of a connectionist learning algorithm, error back-propagation, on a fine-grained parallel computer, the Connection Machine. As an example of how the system can be used, we present a parallel implementation of NETtalk, a connectionist network that learns the mapping from English text to the pronunciation of that text. Currently, networks containing up to 16 million links can be simulated on the Connection Machine at speeds nearly twice that of the Cray-2. We found the major impediment to further speed-up to be the communications between processors, and not processor speed per se. We believe that the advantage for parallel computers will become even clearer as developments in parallel computing continue.}

I cannot on this occasion give a survey ofthe scientific developments that have led to this result; I will only recall the discovery of the electron towards the close of the last century, which furnished the direct verification and led to a conclusive formulation of the conception of the atomic nature of electricity which had evolved since the discovery by Faraday of the fundamental laws of electrolysis and Berzelius's electrochemical theory, and had its greatest triumph in the electrolytic dissociation theory of Arrhenius. This discovery of the electron and elucidation of its properties was the result of the work of a large number of investigators, among whom Lenard and J. J. Thomson may be particularly mentioned. The latter especially has made very important contributions to our subject by his ingenious attempts to develop ideas about atomic constitution on the basis of the electron theory. The present state of our knowledge of the elements of atomic structure was reached, however, by the discovery of the atomic nucleus, which we owe to Rutherford, whose work on the radioactive substances discovered towards the close of the last century has much enriched physical and chemical science.},

Although the modifications of quantum mechanics have rendered some parts of the work obsolete, many of the topics dealt with still yield to the classical-mechanics approach outlined by Boltzmann; moreover, a variety of problems in aerodynamics, nuclear reactors, and thermonuclear power generation are best solved by Boltzmann's famous transport equation.The work is divided into two parts: Part I deals with the theory of gases with monatomic particles, whose dimensions are negligible compared to the mean free path. Topics include molecules as elastic spheres and as centers of force, external forces and visible motions of the gas and the repelling force between molecules. Part II covers van der Waals' theory, the principles of general mechanics needed for a gas theory, gases with compound molecules, derivation of van der Waals' equation by means of the virial concept, theory of dissociation and supplements to the laws of thermal equilibrium in gases with compound molecules.Combining rigorous mathematical analysis with pragmatic treatment of physical and chemical applications, Lectures on Gas Theory was the standard work on kinetic theory in the first quarter of the 20th century. It remains "one of the greatest books in the history of exact sciences." {\texthorizontalbar} Mark Kac.},

  abstract = {The human brain has some capabilities that the brains of other animals lack. It is to these distinctive capabilities that our species owes its dominant position. Other animals have stronger muscles or sharper claws, but we have cleverer brains. If machine brains one day come to surpass human brains in general intelligence, then this new superintelligence could become very powerful. As the fate of the gorillas now depends more on us humans than on the gorillas themselves, so the fate of our species then would come to depend on the actions of the machine superintelligence. But we have one advantage: we get to make the first move. Will it be possible to construct a seed AI or otherwise to engineer initial conditions so as to make an intelligence explosion survivable? How could one achieve a controlled detonation? To get closer to an answer to this question, we must make our way through a fascinating landscape of topics and considerations. Read the book and learn about oracles, genies, singletons; about boxing methods, tripwires, and mind crime; about humanity's cosmic endowment and differential technological development; indirect normativity, instrumental convergence, whole brain emulation and technology couplings; Malthusian economics and dystopian evolution; artificial intelligence, and biological cognitive enhancement, and collective intelligence. --},

In refereeing papers for NIPS the author was struck by the growing emphasis on mathematical theory. Mathematical theory is not critical to the development of machine learning. In machine learning, the current panacea is a sigmoid network fitted using backpropagation. The pi-method, for approximating functions using noisy data, was suggested by results in mathematical approximation theory. In spite of intense activity, none of the work has had any effect on the day-to-day practice of statistics, or even on present-day theory. The useful theories was not meant to be inclusive, but even a more inclusive list would be very short. A possible reason is that it is difficult to formulate reasonable analytic models for complex data.},

  abstract = {The set of computer programs known as HEURISTIC DENDRAL is an attempt to develop machine intelligence in a scientific field. In particular its task domain is the analysis of mass spectra, chemical data gathered routinely from a relatively new analytical instrument, the mass spectrometer. HEURISTIC DENDRAL has been developed as a joint project of the Departments of Computer Science, Chemistry, and Genetics at Stanford University. This collaboration of chemists and computer scientists has produced what appears to be an interesting program from the viewpoint of artificial intelligence and a useful tool from the viewpoint of chemistry. For this discussion it is sufficient to say that a mass spectrometer is an instrument into which is put a minute sample of some chemical compound and out of which comes data usually represented as a bar graph. This is what is referred to here as the mass spectrum. The instrument itself bombards molecules of the compound with electrons, thereby producing ions of different masses in varying proportions. The x-points of the bar graph represent the masses of ions produced and the y-points represent the relative abundances of ions of these masses. The HEURISTIC DENDRAL process of analysing a mass spectrum by computer consists of three phases. The first, preliminary inference (or planning), obtains clues from the data as to which classes of chemical compounds are suggested or forbidden by the data. The second phase, structure generation, enumerates all possible explicit structural hypotheses which are compatible with the inferences made in phase one. The third phase, prediction and testing, predicts consequences from each structural},

  abstract = {This paper presents a systematic analysis of the role of opponent type processing in colour vision and the relation between opponent type colour transformations and the initial three colour mechanisms. It is shown that efficient information transmission is achieved by a transformation of the initial three colour mechanisms into an achromatic and two opponent chromatic channels. The derivation of the transformation is dependent solely on criteria from information theory. Thus it provides a logical rationale reconciling opponent type processing as an optimal necessary step after the initial three colour mechanisms, unifying respectively the Hering and Young-Helmholtz approaches to colour vision. The effects of chromatic adaptation on the spectral response of the achromatic and two chromatic channels are discussed from the point of view of information theory. It is argued that adaptation serves as a dynamic readjustment of these responses, necessary to meet criteria of efficient colour information transmission. The results are confronted with empirical observations to test the principles of the theory and the relation to other theories is discussed. Within the same framework the issue of trichromacy is discussed. It is argued that a broad class of typical colour spectra can effectively be represented by three significant degrees of freedom that make up a trichromatic system.},

This implies that the distance between two colors is the length of the shortest path that connects them. We show that a Riemannian metric overestimates the perception of large color differences because large color differences are perceived as less than the sum of small differences. This effect, called diminishing returns, cannot exist in a Riemannian geometry. Consequently, we need to adapt how we model color differences, as the current standard,                                                                        {$\Delta$}                     E                                                                  , recognized by the International Commission for Weights and Measures, does not account for diminishing returns in color difference perception.                        ,              The scientific community generally agrees on the theory, introduced by Riemann and furthered by Helmholtz and Schr{\"o}dinger, that perceived color space is not Euclidean but rather, a three-dimensional Riemannian space. We show that the principle of diminishing returns applies to human color perception. This means that large color differences cannot be derived by adding a series of small steps, and therefore, perceptual color space cannot be described by a Riemannian geometry. This finding is inconsistent with the current approaches to modeling perceptual color space. Therefore, the assumed shape of color space requires a paradigm shift. Consequences of this apply to color metrics that are currently used in image and video processing, color mapping, and the paint and textile industries. These metrics are valid only for small differences. Rethinking them outside of a Riemannian setting could provide a path to extending them to large differences. This finding further hints at the existence of a second-order Weber--Fechner law describing perceived differences.},

  year = {1982},

  abstract = {The renormalization-group approach is largely responsible for the considerable success which has been achieved in the last ten years in developing a complete quantitative theory of phase transitions. Before, there was a useful physical picture of phase transitions, but a general method for making accurate quantitative predictions was lacking. Existent theories, such as the mean-field theory of Landau, sometimes reproduce phase diagrams reliably but were known to fail qualitatively near critical points, where the critical behavior is particularly interesting be\- cause of its universal character. In the mid 1960's Widom found that the singularities in thermodynamic quanti\- ties were well described by homogeneous functions. Kadanoff extended the homogeneity hypothesis to correlation functions and linked it to the idea of scale invariance. In the early 1970's Wilson showed how Kadanoff's rescaling could be explicitly carried out near the fixed point of a flow in Hamiltonian space. He made the first practical renormalization-group calculation of the flow induced by the elimination of short-wave-length Fourier components of the order-parameter field. The univer\- sality of the critical behavior emerges in a natural way in this approach, with a different fixed point for each universality class. The discovery by Wilson and Fisher of a systematic expansion procedure in E for a system in d = 4 - E dimen\- sions was followed by a cascade of calculations of critical quantities as a function of d and of the order-parameter dimensionality n.},

  abstract = {Macroeconomic policy is one of the most important policy domains, and the tools of macroeconomics are among the most valuable for policy makers. Yet there has been, up to now, a wide gulf between the level at which macroeconomics is taught at the undergraduate level and the level at which it is practiced. At the same time, doctoral-level textbooks are usually not targeted at a policy audience, making advanced macroeconomics less accessible to current and aspiring practitioners. This book, born out of the Masters course the authors taught for many years at the Harvard Kennedy School, fills this gap. It introduces the tools of dynamic optimization in the context of economic growth, and then applies them to a wide range of policy questions - ranging from pensions, consumption, investment and finance, to the most recent developments in fiscal and monetary policy. It does so with the requisite rigor, but also with a light touch, and an unyielding focus on their application to policy-making, as befits the authors' own practical experience. Advanced Macroeconomics: An Easy Guide is bound to become a great resource for graduate and advanced undergraduate students, and practitioners alike.},

In the second stage, peephole templates are generated for each character in such a way as to guarantee discrimination against other characters in the same similarity class. Recognition is preceded by establishing an order of search through the groups with a relatively small number of ``group masks.'' The character is then identified by means of the ``individual masks.'' through a threshold criterion. The effects on the error and reject rates of varying the several parameters in the design and test procedure are described on the basis of computer simulation experiments on a 20 000 character data set. An error rate of 1 percent with 7 percent rejects, is obtained on new data.},

  abstract = {Most of us get inspired by and interact with the world around us based on visual cues such as the colors and patterns that we see. In nature, coloration takes three primary forms: pigmentary coloration, structural coloration, and bioluminescence. Typically, pigmentary and structural coloration are used by animals and plants for their survival; however, few organisms are able to capture the nearly instantaneous and visually astounding display that cephalopods (e.g., octopi, squid, and cuttlefish) exhibit. Notably, the structural coloration of these cephalopods critically relies on a unique family of proteins known as reflectins. As a result, there is growing interest in characterizing the structure and function of such optically-active proteins (e.g., reflectins) and to leverage these materials across a broad range of disciplines, including bioengineering. In this review, I begin by briefly introducing pigmentary and structural coloration in animals and plants as well as highlighting the extraordinary appearance-changing capabilities of cephalopods. Next, I outline recent advances in the characterization and utilization of reflectins for photonic technologies and and discuss general strategies and limitations for the structural and optical characterization of proteins. Finally, I explore future directions of study for optically-active proteins and their potential applications. Altogether, this review aims to bring together an interdisciplinary group of researchers who can resolve the fundamental questions regarding the structure, function, and self-assembly of optically-active protein-based materials.},

It is not a mere reorganization of the data into a new kind of library catalogue, nor another specualtive philosophy about the nature of man and language, but rather a rigorus explication of our intuitions about our language in terms of an overt axiom system, the theorems derivable from it, explicit results which may be compared with new data and other intuitions, all based plainly on an overt theory of the internal structure of languages; and it may well provide an opportunity for the application of explicity measures of simplicity to decide preference of one form over another form of grammar; Includes bibliographical references (pages 115-117); Introduction --- The Independence of Grammar --- An Elementary Linguistic Theory --- Phrase Structure --- Limitations of Phrase Structure Description --- On the Goals of Linguistic Theory --- Some Transformations in English --- The Explanatory Power of Linguistic Theory --- Syntax and Semantics --- Summary --- Appendix I: Notations and Terminology --- Appendix II: Examples of English Phrase Structure and Transformational Rules},

The alignment between the input and output sequences is established using an attention mechanism: the decoder emits each symbol based on a context created with a subset of input symbols elected by the attention mechanism. We report initial results demonstrating that this new approach achieves phoneme error rates that are comparable to the state-of-the-art HMM-based decoders, on the TIMIT dataset.},

  abstract = {Atomic force microscopes and optical tweezers are widely used to probe                     the mechanical properties of individual molecules and molecular interactions, by                     exerting mechanical forces that induce transitions such as unfolding or                     dissociation. These transitions often occur under nonequilibrium conditions and                     are associated with hysteresis effects---features usually taken to                     preclude the extraction of equilibrium information from the experimental data.                     But fluctuation theorems-- allow us to                     relate the work along nonequilibrium trajectories to thermodynamic free-energy                     differences. They have been shown to be applicable to single-molecule force                         measurements and have already                     provided information on the folding free energy of a RNA hairpin,. Here we                     show that the Crooks fluctuation theorem                     can be used to determine folding free energies for folding and unfolding                     processes occurring in weak as well as strong nonequilibrium regimes, thereby                     providing a test of its validity under such conditions. We use optical                         tweezers to measure repeatedly the                     mechanical work associated with the unfolding and refolding of a small RNA                         hairpin and an RNA three-helix                         junction. The resultant work                     distributions are then analysed according to the theorem and allow us to                     determine the difference in folding free energy between an RNA molecule and a                     mutant differing only by one base pair, and the thermodynamic stabilizing effect                     of magnesium ions on the RNA structure.},

Analysts were to be able to use the TKB to pose terrorism-related queries, and to help them derive answers to those questions, integrate data, correlate observations, compose explanations, and, in general, augment their ability to effectively complete the reasoning tasks that they need to perform.},

Also, in these sections, I will discuss features of their familial relationships that affected their youth, their psychology, and the shaping of their characters. I will compare their writing styles emphasizing the differences observed between Gibbs's dense and austere style, unlike Duhem's detailed and informative way of writing his essays. I will further examine the way by which each physicist used Mach's doctrine of the economy of thought in shaping their writing style. A final contrast is reserved for their pedagogical styles. In this case, I will let their students and colleagues speak for them, while I comment on why they did not leave behind a school of thought.},

An observer bound to the portion of matter will associate with it a frequency determined by its internal energy, namely, by its ``mass at rest.'' An observer for whom a portion of matter is in steady motion with velocity c, will see this frequency lower in consequence of the Lorentz-Einstein time transformation. I have been able to show (Comptes rendus, September 10 and 24, of the Paris Academy of Sciences) that the fixed observer will constantly see the internal periodical phenomenon in phase with a wave the frequency of which is determined by the quantum relation using the whole energy of the moving body---provided it is assumed that the wave spreads with the velocity c/. This wave, the velocity of which is greater than c, cannot carry energy.},

  abstract = {It has long been established that predictive models can be transformed into lossless compressors and vice versa. Incidentally, in recent years, the machine learning community has focused on training increasingly large and powerful self-supervised (language) models. Since these large language models exhibit impressive predictive capabilities, they are well-positioned to be strong compressors. In this work, we advocate for viewing the prediction problem through the lens of compression and evaluate the compression capabilities of large (foundation) models. We show that large language models are powerful general-purpose predictors and that the compression viewpoint provides novel insights into scaling laws, tokenization, and in-context learning. For example, Chinchilla 70B, while trained primarily on text, compresses ImageNet patches to 43.4\% and LibriSpeech samples to 16.4\% of their raw size, beating domain-specific compressors like PNG (58.5\%) or FLAC (30.3\%), respectively. Finally, we show that the prediction-compression equivalence allows us to use any compressor (like gzip) to build a conditional generative model.},

It was also considered by Rayleigh in the determination of pressure caused by vibration, and the general approach we follow here is based on his. Specific calculation of invariants in classical and quantum mechanics are determined. The Hertz invariant, which is a volume in phase space, is extended to the case of a variable number of particles. We show that the slow parametric change leads to the adiabatic process, allowing the definition of entropy as a parametric invariance.},

  abstract = {The subject of this book is threshold elements, and the problem consists of several questions aimed at the logical capabilities of a single threshold element and at the synthesis or design of combinational digital systems (e.g., computers) using these devices. A threshold element is primarily a logical gate or a basic building block, and it is one of the most powerful gates known to us today. The work is important on three counts: It is the first book on the subject of threshold elements; it presents an approach not often encountered in the design of digital systems; and it contains primarily original results which answer the basic problem in a number of ways. These results which include a number of synthesis procedures are presented in detail and are illustrated with examples. In the interest of continuity, some results of other investigators are briefly, though fully, explained. THRESHOLD LOGIC: A Synthesis Approach shows how a basic approach (correlation) can be used in treating the questions of threshold element synthesis. A number of scattered concepts are unified through this approach under one idea (the characteristic-vector language). This monograph should interest students and engineers as well as researchers in the fields of threshold logic, logic design, and switching theory in general, as well as in bionics and in computer design.},

  abstract = {The importance in General Relativity of different types of initial value problems (i.v.p's), especially those based on null or characteristic hypersurfaces, is discussed. This leads to the idea of decomposing space-time into two families of space-like hypersurfaces. Such a decomposition suggests that the freely specifiable initial data or gravitational degrees of freedom of the theory may be cast into the so-called conformal 2-structure. The formalism for describing this decomposition, called the co-variant orthogonal \{2+2\{ formalism, is outlined in some detail. Subsequently the refinement which enables particular holonomic and anholonomic i.v.p's to be handled is introduced and illustrated by a particular i.v.p. (the anholonomic double null i.v.p.). A short discussion of computer implementation of formalisms is followed by some general remarks about the field of Numerical Relativity.\vphantom{\}\}}},

  abstract = {A ``frame of reference'' is a standard relative to whichmotion and rest may be measured; any set of points or objects that areat rest relative to one another enables us, in principle, to describethe relative motions of bodies. A frame of reference is therefore apurely kinematical device, for the geometrical description of motionwithout regard to the masses or forces involved. A dynamical accountof motion leads to the idea of an ``inertial frame,'' or areference frame relative to which motions have distinguished dynamicalproperties. For that reason an inertial frame has to be understood asa spatial reference frame together with some means of measuring time,so that uniform motions can be distinguished from accelerated motions.The laws of Newtonian dynamics provide a simple definition: aninertial frame is a reference-frame with a time-scale, relative towhich the motion of a body not subject to forces is always rectilinearand uniform, accelerations are always proportional to and in thedirection of applied forces, and applied forces are always met withequal and opposite reactions. It follows that, in an inertial frame,the center of mass of a closed system of interacting bodies is alwaysat rest or in uniform motion. It also follows that any other frame ofreference moving uniformly relative to an inertial frame is also aninertial frame. For example, in Newtonian celestial mechanics, takingthe ``fixed stars'' as a frame of reference, we can, inprinciple, determine an (approximately) inertial frame whose center isthe center of mass of the solar system; relative to this frame, everyacceleration of every planet can be accounted for (approximately) as agravitational interaction with some other planet in accord withNewton's laws of motion.},

Central to this membrane's structure-function relationships is a quasi-two-dimensional meshwork of spectrin-actin-protein 4.1 that imparts a resilence to the overlying plasma membrane. New insights into the nonlinear microelasticity of this substructure are being provided by experiments that range from elegant atomic force microscopy tests of single spectrin chains to patterned photobleaching of the micropipette-deformed network. Breakthroughs in atomic level structure determinations are further complemented by emerging biophysical studies of transgenically engineered mice lacking specific erythrocyte membrane proteins. Recent theoretical efforts (computational approaches most notably) also have begun to correlate molecular scale aspects of structure with mechanical measures. All of this recent activity in the biophysics of erythrocyte structure-function is certain to challenge and refine some of the most basic tenets in cell membrane structure-function.},

  abstract = {The adaptive origins of primates and anthropoid primates are topics of enduring interest to biological anthropologists. A convention in these discussions is to treat the light environment as binary---night is dark, day is light---and to impute corresponding selective pressure on the visual systems and behaviors of primates. In consequence, debate has tended to focus on whether a given trait can be interpreted as evidence of nocturnal or diurnal behavior in the primate fossil record. Such classification elides the variability in light, or the ways that primates internalize light in their environments. Here, we explore the liminality of light by focusing on what it is, its many sources, and its flux under natural conditions. We conclude by focusing on the intensity and spectral properties of twilight, and we review the mounting evidence of its importance as a cue that determines the onset or offset of primate activities as well as the entrainment of circadian rhythms.},

The unification of space and time introduced by Einstein's special theory of relativity is one of the cornerstones of the modern scientific description of the universe. Yet the unification is counterintuitive because we perceive time very differently from space. Even in relativity, time is not just another dimension, it is one with different properties The book treats the geometry of hyperbolas as the key to understanding special relativity. The author simplifies the formulas and emphasizes their geometric content. Many important relations, including the famous relativistic addition formula for velocities, then follow directly from the appropriate (hyperbolic) trigonometric addition formulas. Prior mastery of (ordinary) trigonometry is sufficient for most of the material presented, although occasional use is made of elementary differential calculus, and the chapter on electromagnetism assumes some more advanced knowledge. Changes to the Second Edition The treatment of Minkowski space and spacetime diagrams has been expanded. Several new topics have been added, including a geometric derivation of Lorentz transformations, a discussion of three-dimensional spacetime diagrams, and a brief geometric description of "area" and how it can be used to measure time and distance. Minor notational changes were made to avoid conflict with existing usage in the literature"--},

Unlike computers, humans bring in a great deal of prior knowledge about the world, enabling efficient decision making. This paper investigates the role of human priors for solving video games. Given a sample game, we conduct a series of ablation studies to quantify the importance of various priors on human performance. We do this by modifying the video game environment to systematically mask different types of visual information that could be used by humans as priors. We find that removal of some prior knowledge causes a drastic degradation in the speed with which human players solve the game, e.g. from 2 minutes to over 20 minutes. Furthermore, our results indicate that general priors, such as the importance of objects and visual consistency, are critical for efficient game-play.

It traces how the old quantum theory of Bohr and Sommerfeld gave way to the matrix mechanics of Heisenberg and others and to the wave mechanics of Schr{\"o}dinger. It then turns to the emergence of statistical transformation theory and the Hilbert space formalism unifying these two forms of the new quantum theory. It uses the metaphor of an arch built on a scaffold to capture these developments. The volume provides detailed analyses of the classic papers of Heisenberg, Born, Jordan, Pauli, Dirac, De Broglie, Einstein, Schr{\"o}dinger, von Neumann and others laying the foundations of modern quantum mechanics. Drawing on correspondence and later reminiscences of these authors and synthesizing much of the extensive secondary literature on the breakthrough to modern quantum mechanics in the mid-1920s, this volume presents an authoritative new account of the genesis of quantum mechanics.

  abstract = {We investigate algorithmic progress in image classification on ImageNet, perhaps the most well-known test bed for computer vision. We estimate a model, informed by work on neural scaling laws, and infer a decomposition of progress into the scaling of compute, data, and algorithms. Using Shapley values to attribute performance improvements, we find that algorithmic improvements have been roughly as important as the scaling of compute for progress computer vision. Our estimates indicate that algorithmic innovations mostly take the form of compute-augmenting algorithmic advances (which enable researchers to get better performance from less compute), not data-augmenting algorithmic advances. We find that compute-augmenting algorithmic advances are made at a pace more than twice as fast as the rate usually associated with Moore's law. In particular, we estimate that compute-augmenting innovations halve compute requirements every nine months (95{\textbackslash}\% confidence interval: 4 to 25 months).},

  abstract = {The beginnings of cybernetics were marked by the publication of two papers in 1943. In the first one, Rosenblueth, Wiener, and Bigelow claimed that purposeful behavior is a circular process controlled by negative feedback. In the second seminal paper, McCulloch and Pitts proposed that neurons are interconnected working as logical operators. Both articles raised human-machine analogies and mathematically formulated cognitive mechanisms. These ideas ignited the interest of von Neumann, who was developing the first stored-program computer. Thus, after a preliminary meeting in 1945, a series of meetings were held between 1946 and 1953. The role of the Spanish neurophysiologist Rafael Lorente de N{\'o} in the beginnings of cybernetics is attested not only by his participation in the core members of these Macy conferences but also for his previous description of reverberating circuits formed by a closed chain of internuncial neurons. This was the first neurobiologic demonstration of a feedback loop. Most researchers considered the central nervous system as a mere reflex organ until then; nevertheless, he demonstrated a self-sustained central activity in the nervous system, supporting the idea of self-regulating mechanisms as a key concept not just in machines but also in the brain.},

These reasons include misconceptions by the legal community about Bayes' theorem, overreliance on the use of the likelihood ratio, and the lack of adoption of modern computational methods. We argue that Bayesian networks, which automatically produce the necessary Bayesian calculations, provide an opportunity to address most concerns about using Bayes in the law.},

We discuss the estimation of entropy rate from empirical data, and review both parametric and non-parametric techniques. We look at many different assumptions on properties of the processes for parametric processes, in particular focussing on Markov and Gaussian assumptions. Non-parametric estimation relies on limit theorems which involve the entropy rate from observations, and to discuss these, we introduce some theory and the practical implementations of estimators of this type.},

Are these truly effects on perception, or might some instead reflect influences on judgment, memory, or response bias? Here, we exploited an infamous art-historical reasoning error (the so-called ``El Greco fallacy'') to demonstrate that multiple alleged top-down effects (including effects of morality on lightness perception and effects of action capabilities on spatial perception) cannot truly be effects on perception. We suggest that this error may also contaminate several other varieties of top-down effects and that this discovery has implications for debates over the continuity (or lack thereof) of perception and cognition.},

Specific reference is made to the formation of the Brown Standard Corpus. The formation of a corpus is justified in terms of saving effort and in providing a compilation of data that will serve as a research tool in comparative studies. Important questions in the process concern the body of language from which the sample will be drawn, the size of the sample, and its structure. These, in turn, are dependent on the purpose for which the corpus is assembled: graphic analysis will require a different corpus than will phonological or  grammatical analysis, for example, the latter presenting the most problems. Practical constraints on the size of the corpus, including time, energy and money are mentioned. The organization of the corpus is discussed, underlining such factors as the size of the base units, mode of selection and collection, assembly of the corpus and computerization. The question of how much additional explanatory material should accompany the corpus is raised, with particular reference to lexical and semantic analyses. (CLK)},

The model V satisfies the ground axiom GA if there are no such W properly contained in V. The model W is a bedrock of V if W is a ground of V and satisfies the ground axiom. The mantle of V is the intersection of all grounds of V. The generic mantle of V is the intersection of all grounds of all set-forcing extensions of V. The generic HOD, written gHOD, is the intersection of all HODs of all set-forcing extensions. The generic HOD is always a model of ZFC, and the generic mantle is always a model of ZF. Every model of ZFC is the mantle and generic mantle of another model of ZFC. We prove this theorem while also controlling the HOD of the final model, as well as the generic HOD. Iteratively taking the mantle penetrates down through the inner mantles to what we call the outer core, what remains when all outer layers of forcing have been stripped away.

The usual approach is turned on its side by using the mathematical description of these regulatory motifs as a predictive tool to determine the number of repressors in a collection of strains with a large variation in repressor copy number. The predictions and corresponding measurements are carried out over a large dynamic range in both expression fold change (spanning nearly four orders of magnitude) and repressor copy number (spanning about two orders of magnitude). The predictions are tested by measuring the resulting level of gene expression and are then validated by using quantitative immunoblots. The key outcomes of this study include a systematic quantitative analysis of the limits and validity of the input--output relation for simple repression, a precise determination of the in vivo binding energies for DNA--repressor interactions for several distinct repressor binding sites, and a repressor census for Lac repressor in               Escherichia coli               .},

  abstract = {Deep learning has triggered the current rise of artificial intelligence and is the workhorse of today's machine intelligence. Numerous success stories have rapidly spread all over science, industry and society, but its limitations have only recently come into focus. In this Perspective we seek to distil how many of deep learning's failures can be seen as different symptoms of the same underlying problem: shortcut learning. Shortcuts are decision rules that perform well on standard benchmarks but fail to transfer to more challenging testing conditions, such as real-world scenarios. Related issues are known in comparative psychology, education and linguistics, suggesting that shortcut learning may be a common characteristic of learning systems, biological and artificial alike. Based on these observations, we develop a set of recommendations for model interpretation and benchmarking, highlighting recent advances in machine learning to improve robustness and transferability from the lab to real-world applications.},

In way of conclusion, we suggest that current-generation feedforward neural networks are largely inadequate for difficult problems in machine perception and machine learning, regardless of parallel-versus-serial hardware or other implementation issues. Furthermore, we suggest that the fundamental challenges in neural modeling are about representation rather than learning per se. This last point is supported by additional experiments with handwritten numerals.},

It is appealing because of its potential to perform superfast algorithms, such as finding prime factors in polynomial time, but also elusive because of the difficulty of simultaneously manipulating quantum degrees of freedom while preventing environmentally induced decoherence. A new approach to quantum computing is introduced based on the use of multiple-pulse resonance techniques to manipulate the small deviation from equilibrium of the density matrix of a macroscopic ensemble so that it appears to be the density matrix of a much lower dimensional pure state. A complete prescription for quantum computing is given for such a system.},

But, despite much work, there has been no equally satisfactory general variational principle for nonequilibrium situations. However, in 1980, a new avenue was opened by E.T. Jaynes and by Shore and Johnson. We review here maximum caliber, which is a maximum-entropy-like principle that can infer distributions of flows over pathways, given dynamical constraints. This approach is providing new insights, particularly into few-particle complex systems, such as gene circuits, protein conformational reaction coordinates, network traffic, bird flocking, cell motility, and neuronal firing.},

  abstract = {Language learnability has been investigated. This refers to the following situation: A class of possible languages is specified, together with a method of presenting information to the learner about an unknown language, which is to be chosen from the class. The question is now asked, ``Is the information sufficient to determine which of the possible languages is the unknown language?'' Many definitions of learnability are possible, but only the following is considered here: Time is quantized and has a finite starting time. At each time the learner receives a unit of information and is to make a guess as to the identity of the unknown language on the basis of the information received so far. This process continues forever. The class of languages will be considered learnable with respect to the specified method of information presentation if there is an algorithm that the learner can use to make his guesses, the algorithm having the following property: Given any language of the class, there is some finite time after which the guesses will all be the same and they will be correct. In this preliminary investigation, a language is taken to be a set of strings on some finite alphabet. The alphabet is the same for all languages of the class. Several variations of each of the following two basic methods of information presentation are investigated: A text for a language generates the strings of the language in any order such that every string of the language occurs at least once. An informant for a language tells whether a string is in the language, and chooses the strings in some order such that every string occurs at least once. It was found that the class of context-sensitive languages is learnable from an informant, but that not even the class of regular languages is learnable from a text.},

When applied to written English, NSRPS gives entropy estimates which are very close to those obtained by other methods. Using ca. 135 GB of input data from the project Gutenberg, we estimate the effective entropy to be \${\textbackslash}approx 1.82\$ bit/character.

It examines claims made by participants in the field that the controversy was triggered, shaped and finally resolved in connection to activities of state research agencies, particularly the US Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). In contrast to these claims, this account concludes that, although ARPA's relations to the controversy among researchers were important, they were indirect. This study thus brings the analytical resources of studies of scientific controversy to bear on a domain which has so far gone largely unexamined in studies of 20th-century controversies - namely, state research policy and management. The account is based on contemporary documents, historical literature, and interviews with researchers and ARPA officials.},

The book begins by applying Lagrange's equations to a number of mechanical systems. It introduces the concepts of generalized coordinates and generalized momentum. Following this the book turns to the calculus of variations to derive the Euler--Lagrange equations. It introduces Hamilton's principle and uses this throughout the book to derive further results. The Hamiltonian, Hamilton's equations, canonical transformations, Poisson brackets and Hamilton--Jacobi theory are considered next. The book concludes by discussing continuous Lagrangians and Hamiltonians and how they are related to field theory. Written in clear, simple language and featuring numerous worked examples and exercises to help students master the material, this book is a valuable supplement to courses in mechanics.},

As AI evolved, and particularly with the identification in the mid-1970s of expert systems as a promising technology, my attention turned to practical applications. In this narrative, I sketch a personal trajectory that mirrors the historical development of AI from its first stirrings to the beginning of the era of deep learning. My path included the first theoretical analysis of a widely used pattern classifier, the creation of the world's first robot with artificial intelligence, the development of the first expert system that provably solved an economically important problem, the founding of the first AI research lab in a commercial company, the founding of an expert systems company, and the restarting of a corporate research center. My account pays special attention to Syntelligence, the expert systems company that represented my most-focused effort to bring AI into the real world.},

Max Cal, a variant of maximum entropy, predicts dynamical distribution functions by maximizing a path entropy subject to dynamical constraints, such as average fluxes. We first show that Max Cal leads to standard near-equilibrium results---including the Green-Kubo relations, Onsager's reciprocal relations of coupled flows, and Prigogine's principle of minimum entropy production---in a way that is particularly simple. We develop some generalizations of the Onsager and Prigogine results that apply arbitrarily far from equilibrium. Because Max Cal does not require any notion of ``local equilibrium,'' or any notion of entropy dissipation, or temperature, or even any restriction to material physics, it is more general than many traditional approaches. It also applicable to flows and traffic on networks, for example.},

However, the original edition has been unavailable since 1966, ensuring that Hebb's comment that a classic normally means "cited but not read" is true in his case. This new edition rectifies a long-standing problem for behavioral neuroscientists--the inability to obtain one of the most cited publications in the field. The Organization of Behavior played a significant part in stimulating the investigation of the neural foundations of behavior and continues to be inspiring because it provides a general framework for relating behavior to synaptic organization through the dynamics of neural networks. D.O. Hebb was also the first to examine the mechanisms by which environment and experience can influence brain structure and function, and his ideas formed the basis for work on enriched environments as stimulants for behavioral development. References to Hebb, the Hebbian cell assembly, the Hebb synapse, and the Hebb rule increase each year. These forceful ideas of 1949 are now applied in engineering, robotics, and computer science, as well as neurophysiology, neuroscience, and psychology--a tribute to Hebb's foresight in developing a foundational neuropsychological theory of the organization of behavior.},

  abstract = {Three factors drive the advance of AI: algorithmic innovation, data, and the amount of compute available for training. Algorithmic progress has traditionally been more difficult to quantify than compute and data. In this work, we argue that algorithmic progress has an aspect that is both straightforward to measure and interesting: reductions over time in the compute needed to reach past capabilities. We show that the number of floating-point operations required to train a classifier to AlexNet-level performance on ImageNet has decreased by a factor of 44x between 2012 and 2019. This corresponds to algorithmic efficiency doubling every 16 months over a period of 7 years. By contrast, Moore's Law would only have yielded an 11x cost improvement. We observe that hardware and algorithmic efficiency gains multiply and can be on a similar scale over meaningful horizons, which suggests that a good model of AI progress should integrate measures from both.},

  abstract = {We investigate the optimal model size and number of tokens for training a transformer language model under a given compute budget. We find that current large language models are significantly undertrained, a consequence of the recent focus on scaling language models whilst keeping the amount of training data constant. By training over 400 language models ranging from 70 million to over 16 billion parameters on 5 to 500 billion tokens, we find that for compute-optimal training, the model size and the number of training tokens should be scaled equally: for every doubling of model size the number of training tokens should also be doubled. We test this hypothesis by training a predicted compute-optimal model, Chinchilla, that uses the same compute budget as Gopher but with 70B parameters and 4\${\textbackslash}times\$ more more data. Chinchilla uniformly and significantly outperforms Gopher (280B), GPT-3 (175B), Jurassic-1 (178B), and Megatron-Turing NLG (530B) on a large range of downstream evaluation tasks. This also means that Chinchilla uses substantially less compute for fine-tuning and inference, greatly facilitating downstream usage. As a highlight, Chinchilla reaches a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 67.5\% on the MMLU benchmark, greater than a 7\% improvement over Gopher.},

The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices.},

Go is played on a board crisscrossed by 19 vertical and 19 horizontal lines whose 361 points of intersection constitute the playing field. The object is to conquer those intersection points.},

  abstract = {Recent work has shown that convolutional networks can be substantially deeper, more accurate, and efficient to train if they contain shorter connections between layers close to the input and those close to the output. In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - our network has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet). DenseNets obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less computation to achieve high performance.

Individuals who become interested in color vision in animals come from a variety of different educational backgrounds{\texthorizontalbar}from the traditional biological and behavioral sciences as well as from more applied fields. Accordingly, this book includes sufficient tutorial information about color vision so that a relative newcomer would be able to make sense out of this area without having to search out still more background material. To provide this, basic information about the psychophysics of color vision and about the methods used to study color vision in animals is presented; along with coverage of the broad range of biological mechanisms responsible for color vision. Subsequent chapters present systematic reviews of studies of color vision in a wide selection of vertebrate species. The final chapter is devoted to a discussion of two fascinating issues raised by studies of animal color vision: the evolutionary origins and the functional utility of color vision.},

  abstract = {We present "Human or Not?", an online game inspired by the Turing test, that measures the capability of AI chatbots to mimic humans in dialog, and of humans to tell bots from other humans. Over the course of a month, the game was played by over 1.5 million users who engaged in anonymous two-minute chat sessions with either another human or an AI language model which was prompted to behave like humans. The task of the players was to correctly guess whether they spoke to a person or to an AI. This largest scale Turing-style test conducted to date revealed some interesting facts. For example, overall users guessed the identity of their partners correctly in only 68\% of the games. In the subset of the games in which users faced an AI bot, users had even lower correct guess rates of 60\% (that is, not much higher than chance). This white paper details the development, deployment, and results of this unique experiment. While this experiment calls for many extensions and refinements, these findings already begin to shed light on the inevitable near future which will commingle humans and AI.},

  abstract = {The reason we never observe violations of the second law of thermodynamics is in part a matter of statistics: When {$\sim$}1023 degrees of freedom are involved, the odds are overwhelmingly stacked against the possibility of seeing significant deviations away from the mean behavior. As we turn our attention to smaller systems, however, statistical fluctuations become more prominent. In recent years it has become apparent that the fluctuations of systems far from thermal equilibrium are not mere background noise, but satisfy strong, useful, and unexpected properties. In particular, a proper accounting of fluctuations allows us to rewrite familiar inequalities of macroscopic thermodynamics as equalities. This review describes some of this progress, and argues that it has refined our understanding of irreversibility and the second law.},

The loss scales as a power-law with model size, dataset size, and the amount of compute used for training, with some trends spanning more than seven orders of magnitude. Other architectural details such as network width or depth have minimal effects within a wide range. Simple equations govern the dependence of overfitting on model/dataset size and the dependence of training speed on model size. These relationships allow us to determine the optimal allocation of a fixed compute budget. Larger models are significantly more sampleefficient, such that optimally compute-efficient training involves training very large models on a relatively modest amount of data and stopping significantly before convergence.},

In the end, it is only the real component that has physical meaning or the two parts (real and imaginary) are treated separately as real quantities. However, the situation seems to be different in quantum mechanics, since the imaginary unit i appears explicitly in its fundamental equations. From a learning perspective, this can create some challenges to newcomers. In this article, four conceptually different justifications for the use/need of complex numbers in quantum mechanics are presented and some pedagogical implications are discussed.},

The aim of the exercise was to test the claim that, with the latest AI technology, large knowledge bases can be built quickly and efficiently. The domain chosen was `workarounds'; that is, planning how a convoy of military vehicles can `work around' (i.e. circumvent or overcome) obstacles in their path, such as blown bridges or minefields. This paper describes the four approaches that were applied to solve this problem. These approaches differed in their approach to knowledge acquisition, in their ontology, and in their reasoning. All four approaches are described and compared against each other. The paper concludes by reporting the results of an evaluation that was carried out by the HPKB program to determine the capability of each of these approaches.},

We formalize three fairness conditions that lie at the heart of these debates, and we prove that except in highly constrained special cases, there is no method that can satisfy these three conditions simultaneously. Moreover, even satisfying all three conditions approximately requires that the data lie in an approximate version of one of the constrained special cases identified by our theorem. These results suggest some of the ways in which key notions of fairness are incompatible with each other, and hence provide a framework for thinking about the trade-offs between them.},

For the case where there is a break in the Nth derivative of {$\omega$} the relative change is given to this order.},

  abstract = {BACON.3 is a production system that discovers empirical laws. Although it does not attempt to model the human discovery process in detail, it incorporates some general heuristics that can lead to discovery in a number of domains. The main heuristics detect constancies and trends in data, and lead to the formulation of hypotheses and the definition of theoretical terms. Rather than making a hard distinction between data and hypotheses, the program represents information at varying levels of description. The lowest levels correspond to direct observations, while the highest correspond to hypotheses that explain everything so for observed. To take advantage of this representation, BACON.3 has the ability to carry out and relate multiple experiments, collapse hypotheses with identical conditions, ignore differences to let similar concepts be treated as equal, and to discover and ignore irrelevant variables. BACON.3 has shown its generality by rediscovering versions of the ideal gas law, Kepler's third law of planetary motion, Coulomb's law, Ohm's law, and Galileo's laws for the pendulum and constant acceleration.},

In the post-Moore era, the Top will provide substantial performance gains, but these gains will be opportunistic, uneven, and sporadic, and they will suffer from the law of diminishing returns. Big system components offer a promising context for tackling the challenges of working at the Top.},

The book features end-of-chapter practice problems, an appendix of worked problems, a glossary of terms, and an annotated bibliography. Accomplished teacher Don S. Lemons uses thermodynamics to solve problems from a broad range of physics. He illustrates not only the fundamentals of the subject but also advanced topics such as the relationship between the second law of thermodynamics and entropy. He highlights the intellectual structure and history of the discipline and explores the logical consequences of each of the famous three laws. Lemons explains and develops the first two laws and their corollaries, the methods and applications of thermodynamics, and the third law, as well as non-fluid variables, equilibrium and stability, and two-phase systems.},

The concept of adiabatic invariance to all orders is formulated precisely in Section I. In Section II, a classical one-dimensional nonlinear oscillator is treated. It is proved that the action integral extended over a period of the instantaneous time independent problem is an adiabatic invariant to all orders. Section III is devoted to the extension of the Born-Fock quantum mechanical adiabatic theorem to all orders. The systems to which the proof applies in all rigor are those which have a finite number of nondegenerate quantum states which do not cross in the process of adiabatic change. The proofs are based on a systematic construction of the asymptotic expansion in the slowness parameter of the statistical distribution function which describes an initially stationary ensemble of systems.}

But -- and this is something that is almost never discussed explicitly -- for it to pass for human, it would also have to exhibit dozens of different kinds of incorrect yet predictable reasoning -- what we might call translogical reasoning. Is it desirable to build such foibles into our programs? In short, we need to unravel several issues that are often tangled up together: How couldwe get a machine to pass the Turing Test? What shouldwe get the machine to do (or not do)? What have we done so far with the Cyc common sense knowledge base and inference system? We describe the most serious technical hurdles we faced, in building Cyc to date, how they each were overcome, and what it would take to close the remaining Turing Test gap.},

At Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation and then at Cycorp, we have systematically codified much of the ``obvious'' knowledge of the world that one rarely articulates since ``everyone'' of course already knows it. Lack of that solid infrastructure limits AIs' trustworthiness: they make mistakes no human would make, and they cannot explain their reasoning. This is the story of my ESs experience and how 50 years of lessons learned led my team to steadily and successfully construct an enormous knowledge-based system that avoids such brittleness.},

  abstract = {Contexts have historically been either ignored completely or else treated as black boxes, as indivisible atoms. About a decade ago, as part of our work on building the large Cyc{\textregistered} knowledge base of human common sense and common knowledge, our group began to study and harness the internal structure of that ``atom''. Each context was said to have assumptions and content; there was a theory of importing assertions across contexts; contexts were fully reified first-class terms in the CycL representation language; they were partially ordered by specialization to control visibility and access to content; and so on. That 1989-91 work turned out to be inadequate: it was too expensive to do nontrivial lifting (importing); to explicate the assumptions of each context; and to place each assertion/query into the proper context. Over the last few years, as the number of Cyc contexts grew into the thousands, we gained a better understanding of the problem -- and a possible solution has emerged. There is a finer internal structure to a context than just those two parts, assumptions and content. There are a dozen mostly-independent dimensions along which contexts vary; conversely, each region of that 12-dimensional space implicitly defines a context. In effect that space is the space of assumptions, and each assertion can be thought to hold true in some region of that space. A more advanced calculus of contexts is required to handle those 12-dimensional constructs, but it should be worth the cost: it should enable a much more efficient, much more focused sort of ``virtual lifting'' of assertions from one context to another, and -- by providing a superstructure that can serve as a principled guide to orient the working KB builder or per user -- it should make it easier to specify the proper context in which an assertion (or question) should be stated. In this paper, we discuss contexts in general, and delineate the dimensions of context-space. We introduce specific terminology for describing points and regions and comparative locations along each dimension. We then consider what ontological engineering will be like in that world.},

  abstract = {Generative AI, the most popular current approach to AI, consists of large language models (LLMs) that are trained to produce outputs that are plausible, but not necessarily correct. Although their abilities are often uncanny, they are lacking in aspects of reasoning, leading LLMs to be less than completely trustworthy. Furthermore, their results tend to be both unpredictable and uninterpretable. We lay out 16 desiderata for future AI, and discuss an alternative approach to AI which could theoretically address many of the limitations associated with current approaches: AI educated with curated pieces of explicit knowledge and rules of thumb, enabling an inference engine to automatically deduce the logical entailments of all that knowledge. Even long arguments produced this way can be both trustworthy and interpretable, since the full step-by-step line of reasoning is always available, and for each step the provenance of the knowledge used can be documented and audited. There is however a catch: if the logical language is expressive enough to fully represent the meaning of anything we can say in English, then the inference engine runs much too slowly. That's why symbolic AI systems typically settle for some fast but much less expressive logic, such as knowledge graphs. We describe how one AI system, Cyc, has developed ways to overcome that tradeoff and is able to reason in higher order logic in real time. We suggest that any trustworthy general AI will need to hybridize the approaches, the LLM approach and more formal approach, and lay out a path to realizing that dream.},

Dr. Lenat was a professor of computer science at Carnegie-Mellon University and at Stanford University. His interest and experience in national security has led him to regularly consult for several U.S. agencies and the White House. ABSTRACT It's way past 2001 now, where the heck is HAL?  For several decades now we've had high hopes for computers amplifying our mental abilities not just giving us access to relevant stored information, but answering our complex, contextual questions.   Even applications like  human-level unrestricted speech understanding continue to dangle close but just out of reach.  What's been holding AI up?   The short answer is that while computers make fine idiot savants, they lack common sense:  the  millions of pieces of general knowledge we all share, and fall back on  as needed, to cope with the rough edges of the real world.  I will talk about how that situation is changing, finally, and what the  timetable -- and the path -- realistically are on achieving Artificial Intelligence.}

One long-range solution is for the program, by itself, to learn via discovery. The first case study presented, AM, demonstrates that new domains of knowledge can be developed mechanically by using heuristics. Yet as new domain concepts, facts, and conjectures emerge, specific new heuristics, or informal judgmental rules, are needed. They in turn can be discovered by using a body of heuristics for guidance. The second case study, EURISKO, has already achieved some promising results in this endeavor. If this process---using heuristics to guide ``learning by discovery''---is so powerful and simple, one wonders why, for instance, nature has not adopted an analogous mechanism to guide evolution. Indeed, the final part of the article is a speculation that evolution does function in that manner. In place of the conventional Darwinian process of random mutation, we hypothesize a more powerful plausible generation scheme.},

(This is an extension of the preceding principle.)3.(3) AI as Empirical Inquiry: Premature mathematization, or focusing on toy problems, washes out details from reality that later turn out to be significant. Thus, we must test our ideas experimentally, falsifiably, on large problems. We present evidence for these propositions, contrast them with other strategic approaches to AI, point out their scope and limitations, and discuss the future directions they mandate for the main enterprise of AI research.},

In the preceding article in this issue of the AI Journal, Ritchie and Hanna focus on that work as they raise several fundamental questions about the methodology of artificial intelligence research. Part of this paper is a response to the specific points they make. It is seen that the difficulties they cite fall into four categories, the most serious of which are omitted heuristics, and the most common of which are miscommunications. Their considerations, and our post-am work on machines that learn, have clarified why am succeeded in the first place, and why it was so difficult to use the same paradigm to discover new heuristics. Those recent insights spawn questions about ``where the meaning really resides'' in the concepts discovered by am. This in turn leads to an appreciation of the crucial and unique role of representation in theory formation, specifically the benefits of having syntax mirror semantics. Some criticism of the paradigm of this work arises due to the ad hoc nature of many pieces of the work; at the end of this article we examine how this very adhocracy may be a potential source of power in itself.},

Our approach is based on a thermodynamic description involving the introduction in the internal energy expression of an extensity, {$\chi$}. {$\chi$} is an Euler's function of the particle mass with a homogeneity degree, m, which can be other than one; m is the thermodynamic dimension of the system. We use this approach to simulate various behaviours, and show that an increase in solubility can be either higher or lower than that envisaged by the Ostwald--Freundlich relation.},

  abstract = {This 25th anniversary edition of Steven Levy's classic book traces the exploits of the computer revolution's original hackers -- those brilliant and eccentric nerds from the late 1950s through the early '80s who took risks, bent the rules, and pushed the world in a radical new direction. With updated material from noteworthy hackers such as Bill Gates, Mark Zukerberg, Richard Stallman, and Steve Wozniak, Hackers is a fascinating story that begins in early computer research labs and leads to the first home computers.  Levy profiles the imaginative brainiacs who found clever and unorthodox solutions to computer engineering problems. They had a shared sense of values, known as "the hacker ethic," that still thrives today. Hackers captures a seminal period in recent history when underground activities blazed a trail for today's digital world, from MIT students finagling access to clunky computer-card machines to the DIY culture that spawned the Altair and the Apple II.   Amazon.com Exclusive: The Rant Heard Round the World  By Steven Levy   Author Steven Levy When I began researching Hackers--so many years ago that it's scary--I thought I'd largely be chronicling the foibles of a sociologically weird cohort who escaped normal human interaction by retreating to the sterile confines of computers labs. Instead, I discovered a fascinating, funny cohort who wound up transforming human interaction, spreading a culture that affects our views about everything from politics to entertainment to business. The stories of those amazing people and what they did is the backbone of Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution.   But when I revisited the book recently to prepare the 25th Anniversary Edition of my first book, it was clear that I had luckily stumbled on the origin of a computer (and Internet) related controversy that still permeates the digital discussion. Throughout the book I write about something I called The Hacker Ethic, my interpretation of several principles implicitly shared by true hackers, no matter whether they were among the early pioneers from MIT's Tech Model Railroad Club (the Mesopotamia of hacker culture), the hardware hackers of Silicon Valley's Homebrew Computer Club (who invented the PC industry), or the slick kid programmers of commercial game software. One of those principles was ``Information Should Be Free.'' This wasn't a justification of stealing, but an expression of the yearning to know more so one could hack more. The programs that early MIT hackers wrote for big computers were stored on paper tapes. The hackers would keep the tapes in a drawer by the computer so anyone could run the program, change it, and then cut a new tape for the next person to improve. The idea of ownership was alien.  This idea came under stress with the advent of personal computers. The Homebrew Club was made of fanatic engineers, along with a few social activists who were thrilled at the democratic possibilities of PCs. The first home computer they could get their hands on was 1975's Altair, which came in a kit that required a fairly hairy assembly process. (Its inventor was Ed Roberts, an underappreciated pioneer who died earlier this year.) No software came with it. So it was a big deal when 19-year-old Harvard undergrad Bill Gates and his partner Paul Allen wrote a BASIC computer language for it. The Homebrew people were delighted with Altair BASIC, but unhappy that Gates and Allen charged real money for it. Some Homebrew people felt that their need for it outweighed their ability to pay. And after one of them got hold of a ``borrowed'' tape with the program, he showed up at a meeting with a box of copies (because it is so easy to make perfect copies in the digital age), and proceeded to distribute them to anyone who wanted one, gratis.  This didn't sit well with Bill Gates, who wrote what was to become a famous ``Letter to Hobbyists,'' basically accusing them of stealing his property. It was the computer-age equivalent to Luther posting the Ninety-Five Theses on the Castle Church. Gate's complaints would reverberate well into the Internet age, and variations on the controversy persist. Years later, when another undergrad named Shawn Fanning wrote a program called Napster that kicked off massive piracy of song files over the Internet, we saw a bloodier replay of the flap. Today, issues of cost, copying and control still rage--note Viacom's continuing lawsuit against YouTube and Google. And in my own business---journalism--availability of free news is threatening more traditional, expensive new-gathering. Related issues that also spring from controversies in Hackers are debates over the ``walled gardens'' of Facebook and Apple's iPad.  I ended the original Hackers with a portrait of Richard Stallman, an MIT hacker dedicated to the principle of free software. I recently revisited him while gathering new material for the 25th Anniversary Edition of Hackers, he was more hard core than ever. He even eschewed the Open Source movement for being insufficiently noncommercial.  When I spoke to Gates for the update, I asked him about his 1976 letter and the subsequent intellectual property wars. ``Don't call it war,'' he said. ``Thank God we have an incentive system. Striking the right balance of how this should work, you know, there's going to be tons of exploration.'' Then he applied the controversy to my own situation as a journalism. ``Things are in a crazy way for music and movies and books,'' he said. ``Maybe magazine writers will still get paid 20 years from now. Who knows? Maybe you'll have to cut hair during the day and just write articles at night.''  So Amazon.com readers, it's up to you. Those who have not read Hackers,, have fun and be amazed at the tales of those who changed the world and had a hell of time doing it. Those who have previously read and loved Hackers, replace your beat-up copies, or the ones you loaned out and never got back, with this beautiful 25th Anniversary Edition from O'Reilly with new material about my subsequent visits with Gates, Stallman, and younger hacker figures like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. If you don't I may have to buy a scissors--and the next bad haircut could be yours! Read Bill Gates' letter to hobbyists},

We explore how properties frequently encountered in physics such as symmetry, locality, compositionality, and polynomial log-probability translate into exceptionally simple neural networks. We further argue that when the statistical process generating the data is of a certain hierarchical form prevalent in physics and machine-learning, a deep neural network can be more efficient than a shallow one. We formalize these claims using information theory and discuss the relation to the renormalization group. We prove various "no-flattening theorems" showing when efficient linear deep networks cannot be accurately approximated by shallow ones without efficiency loss, for example, we show that \$n\$ variables cannot be multiplied using fewer than 2{\textasciicircum}n neurons in a single hidden layer.},

Our further experiments show that such a dataset classifier could learn semantic features that are generalizable and transferable, which cannot be simply explained by memorization.

However, Transformer models, while lacking recurrence, are able to perform such reasoning using far fewer layers than the number of reasoning steps. This raises the question: what solutions are learned by these shallow and non-recurrent models? We find that a low-depth Transformer can represent the computations of any finite-state automaton (thus, any bounded-memory algorithm), by hierarchically reparameterizing its recurrent dynamics. Our theoretical results characterize shortcut solutions, whereby a Transformer with \$o(T)\$ layers can exactly replicate the computation of an automaton on an input sequence of length \$T\$. We find that polynomial-sized \$O({\textbackslash}log T)\$-depth solutions always exist; furthermore, \$O(1)\$-depth simulators are surprisingly common, and can be understood using tools from Krohn-Rhodes theory and circuit complexity. Empirically, we perform synthetic experiments by training Transformers to simulate a wide variety of automata, and show that shortcut solutions can be learned via standard training. We further investigate the brittleness of these solutions and propose potential mitigations.},

We show that the identity is valid for our system, due to the very rapid molecules belonging to the tail of the Maxwell distribution. For the most interesting extreme, when the system volume is large, while the piston is moving with great speed (compared to thermal velocity) for a very short time, the necessary number of independent experimental runs to obtain a reasonable approximation for the free energy from averaging the nonequilibrium work grows exponentially with the system size.},

The first strand has been underpinned by commitment to the goal of artificial intelligence; practitioners of the second strand have been drawn mainly from mathematical logic; and the third strand has been rooted primarily in the verification of computer programs and hardware designs.},

With two carefully designed out-of-equilibrium driving cycles featuring kicks of the control parameter, we demonstrate work extraction up to large fractions of {$kB$}‚Å¢{$T$} or with probabilities substantially greater than 1/2, despite the zero free energy difference over the cycle. Our results are explained in the framework of nonequilibrium fluctuation relations. We thus show that irreversibility can be used as a resource for optimal work extraction even in the absence of feedback from an external operator.},

What has the field discovered in the five subsequent years? Against a background of considerable progress in areas such as speech recognition, image recognition, and game playing, and considerable enthusiasm in the popular press, I present ten concerns for deep learning, and suggest that deep learning must be supplemented by other techniques if we are to reach artificial general intelligence.},

In Vision, Marr describes a general framework for understanding visual perception and touches on broader questions about how the brain and its functions can be studied and understood. Researchers from a range of brain and cognitive sciences have long valued Marr's creativity, intellectual power, and ability to integrate insights and data from neuroscience, psychology, and computation. This MIT Press edition makes Marr's influential work available to a new generation of students and scientists. In Marr's framework, the process of vision constructs a set of representations, starting from a description of the input image and culminating with a description of three-dimensional objects in the surrounding environment. A central theme, and one that has had far-reaching influence in both neuroscience and cognitive science, is the notion of different levels of analysis--in Marr's framework, the computational level, the algorithmic level, and the hardware implementation level. Now, thirty years later, the main problems that occupied Marr remain fundamental open problems in the study of perception. Vision provides inspiration for the continuing efforts to integrate knowledge from cognition and computation to understand vision and the brain."--MIT CogNet},

  abstract = {For human vision to be explained by a computational theory, the first question is plain: What are the problems that the brain solves when we see? It is argued that vision is the construction of efficient symbolic descriptions from images of the world. An important aspect of vision is therefore the choice of representations for the different kinds of information in a visual scene. An overall framework is suggested for extracting shape information from images, in which the analysis proceeds through three representations: (1) the primal sketch, which makes explicit the intensity changes and local two-dimensional geometry of an image; (2) the 2 1/2-D sketch, which is a viewer-centred representation of the depth, orientation and discontinuities of the visible surfaces; and (3) the 3-D model representation, which allows an object-centred description of the three-dimensional structure and organization of a viewed shape. The critical act in formulating computational theories for processes capable of constructing these representations is the discovery of valid constraints on the way the world behaves, that provide sufficient additional information to allow recovery of the desired characteristic. Finally, once a computational theory for a process has been formulated, algorithms for implementing it may be designed, and their performance compared with that of the human visual processor.},

I'd be inclined to bet on this 21st century. It is not surprising that human-level AI has proved difficult and progress has been slow---though there has been important progress. The slowness and the demand to exploit what has been discovered has led many to mistakenly redefine AI, sometimes in ways that preclude human-level AI---by relegating to humans parts of the task that human-level computer programs would have to do. In the terminology of this paper, it amounts to settling for a bounded informatic situation instead of the more general common sense informatic situation.},

  abstract = {Deep learning is a broad set of techniques that uses multiple layers of representation to automatically learn relevant features directly from structured data. Recently, such techniques have yielded record-breaking results on a diverse set of difficult machine learning tasks in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Despite the enormous success of deep learning, relatively little is understood theoretically about why these techniques are so successful at feature learning and compression. Here, we show that deep learning is intimately related to one of the most important and successful techniques in theoretical physics, the renormalization group (RG). RG is an iterative coarse-graining scheme that allows for the extraction of relevant features (i.e. operators) as a physical system is examined at different length scales. We construct an exact mapping from the variational renormalization group, first introduced by Kadanoff, and deep learning architectures based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). We illustrate these ideas using the nearest-neighbor Ising Model in one and two-dimensions. Our results suggests that deep learning algorithms may be employing a generalized RG-like scheme to learn relevant features from data.},

  abstract = {State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as a potential alternative architecture for building large language models (LLMs) compared to the previously ubiquitous transformer architecture. One theoretical weakness of transformers is that they cannot express certain kinds of sequential computation and state tracking (Merrill \& Sabharwal, 2023), which SSMs are explicitly designed to address via their close architectural similarity to recurrent neural networks (RNNs). But do SSMs truly have an advantage (over transformers) in expressive power for state tracking? Surprisingly, the answer is no. Our analysis reveals that the expressive power of SSMs is limited very similarly to transformers: SSMs cannot express computation outside the complexity class \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{TC\}{\textasciicircum}0\$. In particular, this means they cannot solve simple state-tracking problems like permutation composition. It follows that SSMs are provably unable to accurately track chess moves with certain notation, evaluate code, or track entities in a long narrative. To supplement our formal analysis, we report experiments showing that Mamba-style SSMs indeed struggle with state tracking. Thus, despite its recurrent formulation, the "state" in an SSM is an illusion: SSMs have similar expressiveness limitations to non-recurrent models like transformers, which may fundamentally limit their ability to solve real-world state-tracking problems.},

The phenomenal self, however, is not a thing but an ongoing process; it is the content of a "transparent self-model." In Being No One, Metzinger, a German philosopher, draws strongly on neuroscientific research to present a representationalist and functional analysis of what a consciously experienced first-person perspective actually is. Building a bridge between the humanities and the empirical sciences of the mind, he develops new conceptual toolkits and metaphors; uses case studies of unusual states of mind such as agnosia, neglect, blindsight, and hallucinations; and offers new sets of multilevel constraints for the concept of consciousness. Metzinger's central question is: How exactly does strong, consciously experienced subjectivity emerge out of objective events in the natural world? His epistemic goal is to determine whether conscious experience, in particular the experience of being someone that results from the emergence of a phenomenal self, can be analysed on subpersonal levels of description. He also asks if and how our Cartesian intuitions that subjective experiences as such can never be reductively explained are themselves ultimately rooted in the deeper representational structure of our conscious minds},

Since the 1950s, his work involved trying to uncover human thinking processes and replicate them in machines. [Listener: Christopher Sykes]; date recorded: 2011] TRANSCRIPT: So then in my senior year{\dots} I was{\dots} I was majoring in physics mostly and with fairly poor grades because I was doing so many other things{\dots} and I thought I would make up for this by doing a good thesis, but it turned out at Harvard, physics students can't{\dots} they don't have an undergraduate thesis, but they do in math. So, I asked Andy Gleason why can't I just switch to math and do a thesis and he said: 'No problem,' signed something and I decided to do a thesis on fixed point theorems which was a beautiful little fragment of mathematics that{\dots} that I was very interested in. And there was a theorem that{\dots} Kakutani was a professor at Yale and here's an example of a fixed point theorem: Of{\dots} consider that at each point in the world on{\dots} on the earth, there's a temperature and there's a humidity, and these vary continuously over{\dots} over continuous functions. So there's two continuous functions on this sphere. Kakutani{\dots} somebody else had proved that{\dots} I forget who{\dots} Whitney, Professor Whitney, was a friend of mine at Harvard actually, had proved that you can find two points on the earth which are exactly opposite points which have the same temperature and the same humidity. This is rather surprising. So that{\dots} that was a famous fixed point theorem. Or you could say there's, if you consider mountains{\dots}  There's two points which have the same altitude and the same temperature, any two functions. It's very strange, why should that be? Anyway, Kakutani had proved that if you take a{\dots} you can find a triangle, an equilateral triangle, that is{\dots} 60¬∫ angles, the same thing is true, for an equilateral triangle you can find three points which will have the same temperature and pressure{\dots} or temperature and humidity. So that was Kakutani's fixed point theorem. He was a professor at Yale -- I'd never met him actually -- so that's very interesting because it shows that somehow if you have an extra point you can{\dots} you can do a little more because now they're equal at three points.  Isn't that funny? And so then I said: 'Well, what about other... why does it have to be an equilateral triangle?' And so I worked on that a lot and I managed to prove that if it were a right triangle, it was also true and also if it were a triangle which were three points of a regular pentagon, that would be{\dots} the same thing would be true. And that's as far as I got, I couldn't prove it for any old triangle. But, anyway, my proof of the thing for the pentagon impressed Gleason and that was probably why he told Princeton they had to admit me as a graduate student. That's the next step for a mathematician. So it was a great adventure and{\dots} but it always haunted me that I couldn't show this thing for any old triangle.},

In this article, we explore the implications of this view. Rewriting the wave function in a polar form and transforming Schr{\"o}dinger's equation into two real equations, we show that one of them reduces to the continuity equation, and the other, a nonlinear dynamical equation for the probability density. Considering these two equations as if they were the basic equations of quantum mechanics, we apply them to several one-dimensional quantum systems. We show the dispersive properties in the probability densities of stationary states of a particle in a rigid box and in harmonic potential; quasi-classical Gaussian probability densities of a free particle; and coherent states and squeezed states of the harmonic oscillator. We also present the soliton as a quantum mechanical representation of a free particle. We discuss the meaning of the diffusion coefficient     {$\beta$} 2 for each quantum system using a density plot.}

To simulate this function, we propose in this paper a model of the neural network named ``Associatron'' which operates like a human brain in some points. Associatron stores many entities at the same place of its structure, and recalls the whole of any entity from a part of it. From that mechanism some properties are derived, which are expected to be utilized for human-like information processing. After the properties of the model have been analyzed, an Associatron with 180 neurons is simulated by a computer and is applied to simple examples of concept formation and game playing. Hardware realization of an Associatron with 25 neurons and thinking process by the sequence of associations are mentioned, too.},

  abstract = {Neural networks often exhibit emergent behavior, where qualitatively new capabilities arise from scaling up the amount of parameters, training data, or training steps. One approach to understanding emergence is to find continuous {\textbackslash}textit\{progress measures\} that underlie the seemingly discontinuous qualitative changes. We argue that progress measures can be found via mechanistic interpretability: reverse-engineering learned behaviors into their individual components. As a case study, we investigate the recently-discovered phenomenon of ``grokking'' exhibited by small transformers trained on modular addition tasks. We fully reverse engineer the algorithm learned by these networks, which uses discrete Fourier transforms and trigonometric identities to convert addition to rotation about a circle. We confirm the algorithm by analyzing the activations and weights and by performing ablations in Fourier space. Based on this understanding, we define progress measures that allow us to study the dynamics of training and split training into three continuous phases: memorization, circuit formation, and cleanup. Our results show that grokking, rather than being a sudden shift, arises from the gradual amplification of structured mechanisms encoded in the weights, followed by the later removal of memorizing components.},

The concepts of equilibrium and entropy thus acquire new significance, and readers discover how thermodynamic parameters may be calculated from spectroscopic data.Encompassing virtually all of the forms of statistical mechanics customary to undergraduate physical chemistry books, this brief text requires prior acquaintance with only the rudiments of the calculus and a few of the simplest propositions of classical thermodynamics. Appropriate for introductory college chemistry courses, it further lends itself to use as a supplementary text for independent study by more advanced students.},

Two leading mathematicians of the day, David Hilbert and Felix Klein, dug into the new theory with gusto, but had difficulty reconciling it with what was known about the conservation of energy. Knowing of her expertise in invariance theory, they requested Noether's help. To solve the problem, she developed a novel theorem, applicable across all of physics, which relates conservation laws to continuous symmetries{\texthorizontalbar}one of the most important pieces of mathematical reasoning ever developed.Noether's ``first'' and ``second'' theorem was published in 1918. The first theorem relates symmetries under global spacetime transformations to the conservation of energy and momentum, and symmetry under global gauge transformations to charge conservation. In continuum mechanics and field theories, these conservation laws are expressed as equations of continuity. The second theorem, an extension of the first, allows transformations with local gauge invariance, and the equations of continuity acquire the covariant derivative characteristic of coupled matter-field systems. General relativity, it turns out, exhibits local gauge invariance. Noether's theorem also laid the foundation for later generations to apply local gauge invariance to theories of elementary particle interactions. In Dwight E. Neuenschwander's new edition of Emmy Noether's Wonderful Theorem, readers will encounter an updated explanation of Noether's ``first'' theorem. The discussion of local gauge invariance has been expanded into a detailed presentation of the motivation, proof, and applications of the ``second'' theorem, including Noether's resolution of concerns about general relativity. Other refinements in the new edition include an enlarged biography of Emmy Noether's life and work, parallels drawn between the present approach and Noether's original 1918 paper, and a summary of the logic behind Noether's theorem.},

  abstract = {It has been argued that science is generated and validated through processes of controversy, and that controversies are 'closed' through 'rhetorical' processes of 'enrolment of heterogeneous allies and resources.' It has also been argued that, once a controversy is closed, it is increasingly difficult for the 'losing' position to maintain the plausibility of its views, arguments, and interpretations (words like 'reification,' 'inertia,' and 'institutionalisation' have been used to refer to this). Controversies have shaped neural network research throughout its history, from the 1950s to the 1980s. In this dissertation I analyse the history of neural network research using a 'controversy/rhetorical tactics/enrolment of allies and resources/closure' scheme. I claim that the result is a useful and powerful interpretation of the main developments of the evolution of neural network research. The neural network controversy is especially interesting because it was once (in the late 1960s) closed against neural networks, and twenty years later (in the late 1980s) it was reopened. The history of neural network research can be seen as the history of the closure and reopening of the neural network controversy.},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses the scientific controversies that have shaped neural network research from a sociological point of view. It looks at the controversy that surrounded Frank Rosenblatt's perceptron machine in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Rosenblatt was well aware of the main problems of his machine, and that he even insisted on them in his books and papers. Emphasis is given on one of the main problems of early neural network research, namely the issue of training multilayer systems. In the middle of the perceptron controversy, Minsky and Papert embarked on a project aimed at showing the limitations of Rosenblatt's perceptron beyond doubt. The chapter analyzes the main results of that project, and shows that Minsky and Papert, and neural network researchers interpreted those results rather differently. It discusses the processes through which this interpretative flexibility was closed and the effects that the crisis of early neural network research had upon the three most important neural network groups of the time, namely Widrow's group, Rosenblatt's group, and the group at SRI. The chapter also looks at the influence that factors like the emergence of symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) and computer technology had on the closure of the neural network controversy. After the closure of the perceptron controversy, symbol-processing remained the dominant approach to AI over the years, until the early 1980s. Some of the most important aspects of that changing context are reviewed and the history of back-propagation is discussed.},

I devote particular attention to the proofs and arguments of Minsky and Papert, which were interpreted as showing that further progress in neural nets was not possible, and that this approach to AI had to be abandoned. I maintain that this official interpretation of the debate was a result of the emergence, institutionalization and (importantly) legitimation of the symbolic AI approach (with its resource allocation system and authority structure). At the 'research-area' level, there was considerable interpretative flexibility. This interpretative flexibility was further demonstrated by the revival of neural nets in the late 1980s, and subsequent rewriting of the official history of the debate.},

  abstract = {Semi-formally represented knowledge, such as the use of standardized keywords, is a traditional and valuable mechanism for helping people to access information. Extending that mechanism to include formally represented knowledge (based on a shared ontology) presents a more effective way of sharing large bodies of knowledge between groups; reasoning systems that draw on that knowledge are the logical counterparts to tools that perform well on a single, rigidly defined task. The underlying philosophy of the Cyc Project is that software will never reach its full potential until it can react flexibly to a variety of challenges. Furthermore, systems should not only handle tasks automatically, but also actively anticipate the need to perform them. A system that rests on a large, general-purpose knowledge base can potentially manage tasks that require world knowledge, or ``common sense'' -- the knowledge that every person assumes his neighbors also possess. Until that knowledge is fully represented and integrated, tools will continue to be, at best,idiots savants. Accordingly, this paper will in part present progress made in the overall Cyc Project during its twenty-year lifespan -- its vision, its achievements thus far, and the work that remains to be done. We will also describe how these capabilities can be brought together into a useful ambient assistant application.},

  abstract = {The computation demand for machine learning (ML) has grown rapidly recently, which comes with a number of costs. Estimating the energy cost helps measure its environmental impact and finding greener strategies, yet it is challenging without detailed information. We calculate the energy use and carbon footprint of several recent large models-T5, Meena, GShard, Switch Transformer, and GPT-3-and refine earlier estimates for the neural architecture search that found Evolved Transformer. We highlight the following opportunities to improve energy efficiency and CO2 equivalent emissions (CO2e): Large but sparsely activated DNNs can consume {$<$}1/10th the energy of large, dense DNNs without sacrificing accuracy despite using as many or even more parameters. Geographic location matters for ML workload scheduling since the fraction of carbon-free energy and resulting CO2e vary {\textasciitilde}5X-10X, even within the same country and the same organization. We are now optimizing where and when large models are trained. Specific datacenter infrastructure matters, as Cloud datacenters can be {\textasciitilde}1.4-2X more energy efficient than typical datacenters, and the ML-oriented accelerators inside them can be {\textasciitilde}2-5X more effective than off-the-shelf systems. Remarkably, the choice of DNN, datacenter, and processor can reduce the carbon footprint up to {\textasciitilde}100-1000X. These large factors also make retroactive estimates of energy cost difficult. To avoid miscalculations, we believe ML papers requiring large computational resources should make energy consumption and CO2e explicit when practical. We are working to be more transparent about energy use and CO2e in our future research. To help reduce the carbon footprint of ML, we believe energy usage and CO2e should be a key metric in evaluating models, and we are collaborating with MLPerf developers to include energy usage during training and inference in this industry standard benchmark.},

I describe the sense in which modern language models implement genuine theories of language, and I highlight the links between these models and approaches to linguistics that are based on gradient computations and memorized constructions. I also describe why these models undermine strong claims for the innateness of language and respond to several critiques of large language models, including arguments that they can't answer ``why'' questions and skepticism that they are informative about real life acquisition. Most notably, large language models have attained remarkable success at discovering grammar without using any of the methods that some in linguistics insisted were necessary for a science of language to progress.

The product of this effort, SemanticDB, is a suite of software tools and knowledge resources built to facilitate the collection, storage and use of the diverse data needed to conduct clinical research and health care quality reporting. SemanticDB consists of three main components: 1) a content repository driven by a meta-model that facilitates collection and integration of data in an XML format and automatically converts the data to RDF; 2) an inference-mediated, natural language query interface designed to identify patients who meet complex inclusion and exclusion criteria; and 3) a data production pipeline that uses inference to generate customized views of the repository content for statistical analysis and reporting. Since 2008, this system has been used by the Cleveland Clinic's Heart and Vascular Institute to support numerous clinical investigations, and in 2009 Cleveland Clinic was certified to submit data produced in this manner to national quality monitoring databases sponsored by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons and the American College of Cardiology.},

With characteristic wit, lucidity, and insight, Pinker argues that the dogma that the mind has no innate traits-a doctrine held by many intellectuals during the past century-denies our common humanity and our individual preferences, replaces objective analyses of social problems with feel-good slogans, and distorts our understanding of politics, violence, parenting, and the arts. Injecting calm and rationality into debates that are notorious for ax-grinding and mud-slinging, Pinker shows the importance of an honest acknowledgment of human nature based on science and common sense.},

  abstract = {Does knowledge of language consist of mentally-represented rules? Rumelhart and McClelland have described a connectionist (parallel distributed processing) model of the acquisition of the past tense in English which successfully maps many stems onto their past tense forms, both regular (walk/walked) and irregular (go/went), and which mimics some of the errors and sequences of development of children. Yet the model contains no explicit rules, only a set of neuronstyle units which stand for trigrams of phonetic features of the stem, a set of units which stand for trigrams of phonetic features of the past form, and an array of connections between the two sets of units whose strengths are modified during learning. Rumelhart and McClelland conclude that linguistic rules may be merely convenient approximate fictions and that the real causal processes in language use and acquisition must be characterized as the transfer of activation levels among units and the modification of the weights of their connections. We analyze both the linguistic and the developmental assumptions of the model in detail and discover that (1) it cannot represent certain words, (2) it cannot learn many rules, (3) it can learn rules found in no human language, (4) it cannot explain morphological and phonological regularities, (5) it cannot explain the differences between irregular and regular forms, (6) it fails at its assigned task of mastering the past tense of English, (7) it gives an incorrect explanation for two developmental phenomena: stages of overregularization of irregular forms such as bringed, and the appearance of doubly-marked forms such as ated and (8) it gives accounts of two others (infrequent overregularization of verbs ending in t/d, and the order of acquisition of different irregular subclasses) that are indistinguishable from those of rule-based theories. In addition, we show how many failures of the model can be attributed to its connectionist architecture. We conclude that connectionists' claims about the dispensability of rules in explanations in the psychology of language must be rejected, and that, on the contrary, the linguistic and developmental facts provide good evidence for such rules. R{\'e}sum{\'e} La connaissance du langage repose-t-elle sur la repr{\'e}sentation mentale de r{\`e}gles? Rumelhart et McClelland ont d{\'e}velopp{\'e}un mod{\'e}le connectioniste (parallel distributed processing, PDP) de l'acquisition du pass{\'e}anglais qui parvient{\`a}produire la forme pass{\'e}d'un certain nombre de verbes,{\`a}la fois r{\'e}guliers (walk/walked) et irr{\'e}guliers (go/went),{\`a}partir de leurs racines, et qui semble commettre certaines des erreurs et passer par certains des{\'e}tapes de d{\'e}veloppement des enfants qui apprennent le pass{\'e}anglais. Pourtant, le mod{\`e}le ne contient pas de r{\`e}gles explicites; il est exclusivement constitu{\'e}d'un ensemble d'unit{\'e}s qui repr{\'e}sentent des trigrammes de traits phon{\'e}tiques de la racine, d'un ensemble d'unit{\'e}s qui repr{\'e}sentent des trigrammes de traits phon{\'e}tiques de la forme pass{\'e}e de la racine, et d'un r{\'e}seau de connections entre les deux ensembles d'unit{\'e}s, connections dont la force varie en fonction de l'apprentissage. La conclusion de Rumelhart \& McClelland est que les r{\`e}gles linguistiques ne sont peut-e{\textasciicircum}tre en fait que des approximations pratiques et que les processus causaux r{\'e}els de l'utilisation et de l'acquisition du langage doivente{\textasciicircum}tre caract{\'e}ris{\'e}s en termes de transfert de niveaux d'activation entre unit{\'e}s et de modification du poids de leurs connections. Nous avons analys{\'e}en d{\'e}tail les hypoth{\`e}ses linguistiques et de d{\'e}veloppement qui sous-tendent leur mod{\`e}le et avons d{\'e}couvert que (1) le mod{\`e}le ne peut pas repr{\'e}senter certains mots, (2) il ne peut pas apprendre beaucoup de r{\`e}gles, (3) il peut apprendre des r{\`e}gles que l'on ne rencontre dans aucune langue humaine, (4) il ne peut pas expliquer certaines r{\'e}gularit{\'e}s morphologiques et phonologiques, (5) il ne peut pas expliquer les diff{\'e}rences entre formes r{\'e}guli{\'e}res et irr{\'e}guli{\`e}res, (6) il ne parvient pas{\`a}accomplir la ta{\textasciicircum}che qui lui a{\'e}t{\'e}assign{\'e},{\`a}savoir apprendre le pass{\'e}anglais, (7) il explique incorrectement deux ph{\'e}nom{\`e}nes de d{\'e}veloppement: les{\'e}tapes de sur-r{\'e}gularisation de formes irr{\'e}guli{\`e}res comme bringed, et l'apparition de formes doublement marqu{\'e}es comme ated, enfin, (8) il donne une explication de deux autres ph{\'e}nom{\`e}nes (la surr{\'e}gularisation peu fr{\'e}quente des verbes qui se terminent en t/d, et l'ordre d'acquisition des diff{\'e}rentes sous-classes irr{\'e}guli{\`e}res) qui est indiff{\'e}renciable de celle fournie par des th{\'e}ories utilisant des r{\`e}gles. En outre, nous montrons que c'est l'architecture connectioniste du mod{\`e}le qui est responsable de ses nombreux d{\'e}fauts. Notre conclusion est que les affirmations des connectionistes quant{\`a}l'inutilit{\'e}des r{\`e}gles dans les explications doivente{\textasciicircum}tre rejet{\'e}es et quc, bien au contraire, toutes les donn{\'e}es militent en faveur de l'existence de telles r{\`e}gles.}

In this setting, questions about data efficiency, memorization, generalization, and speed of learning can be studied in great detail. In some situations we show that neural networks learn through a process of "grokking" a pattern in the data, improving generalization performance from random chance level to perfect generalization, and that this improvement in generalization can happen well past the point of overfitting. We also study generalization as a function of dataset size and find that smaller datasets require increasing amounts of optimization for generalization. We argue that these datasets provide a fertile ground for studying a poorly understood aspect of deep learning: generalization of overparametrized neural networks beyond memorization of the finite training dataset.},

We unify tasks such as depth estimation, optical flow, and amodal segmentation under the framework of image-to-image translation, and show how diffusion models benefit from scaling training and test-time compute for these perceptual tasks. Through a careful analysis of these scaling properties, we formulate compute-optimal training and inference recipes to scale diffusion models for visual perception tasks. Our models achieve competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods using significantly less data and compute. To access our code and models, see https://scaling-diffusion-perception.github.io .},

Aspects of component subsystems at the acoustic, phonetic, syntactic, and semantic levels are presented. System organizations that are required for effective interaction and use of various component subsystems in the presence of error and ambiguity are discussed.},

The basic concepts and ideas, as well as their mathematical background, are provided, putting Riemann's reasoning into the more general and systematic perspective achieved by later mathematicians and physicists (including Helmholtz, Ricci, Weyl, and Einstein) on the basis of his seminal ideas. Following a historical introduction that positions Riemann's work in the context of his times, the history of the concept of space in philosophy, physics and mathematics is systematically presented. A subsequent chapter on the reception and influence of the text accompanies the reader from Riemann's times to contemporary research. Not only mathematicians and historians of the mathematical sciences, but also readers from other disciplines or those with an interest in physics or philosophy will find this work both appealing and insightful},

Whoever is right, it is assumed that our technological successor will be an upgraded or degraded version of us: Human 2.0. Posthuman Life argues that the enhancement debate projects a human face onto an empty screen. We do not know what will happen and, not being posthuman, cannot anticipate how posthumans will assess the world. If a posthuman future will not necessarily be informed by our kind of subjectivity or morality the limits of our current knowledge must inform any ethical or political assessment of that future. Posthuman Life develops a critical metaphysics of posthuman succession and argues that only a truly speculative posthumanism can support an ethics that meets the challenge of the transformative potential of technology.},

  abstract = {Since World War II, a group of scientists has been attempting to understand the human nervous system and to build computer systems that emulate the brain's abilities. Many of the early workers in this field of neural networks came from cybernetics; others came from neuroscience, physics, electrical engineering, mathematics, psychology, even economics. In this collection of interviews, those who helped to shape the field share their childhood memories, their influences, how they became interested in neural networks, and what they see as its future.The subjects tell stories that have been told, referred to, whispered about, and imagined throughout the history of the field. Together, the interviews form a Rashomon-like web of reality. Some of the mythic people responsible for the foundations of modern brain theory and cybernetics, such as Norbert Wiener, Warren McCulloch, and Frank Rosenblatt, appear prominently in the recollections. The interviewees agree about some things and disagree about more. Together, they tell the story of how science is actually done, including the false starts, and the Darwinian struggle for jobs, resources, and reputation. Although some of the interviews contain technical material, there is no actual mathematics in the book.Contributors : James A.

From antiquity into theeighteenth century, contrary views which denied that space and timeare real entities maintained that the world is necessarily a materialplenum. Concerning space, they held that the idea of empty space is aconceptual impossibility. Space is nothing but an abstraction we useto compare different arrangements of the bodies constituting theplenum. Concerning time, they insisted, there can be no lapse of timewithout change occurring somewhere. Time is merely a measure of cycles of change within the world.},

  abstract = {Commonsense reasoning remains a major challenge in AI, and yet, recent progresses on benchmarks may seem to suggest otherwise. In particular, the recent neural language models have reported above 90\% accuracy on the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), a commonsense benchmark originally designed to be unsolvable for statistical models that rely simply on word associations. This raises an important question---whether these models have truly acquired robust commonsense capabilities or they rely on spurious biases in the dataset that lead to an overestimation of the true capabilities of machine commonsense.                            To investigate this question, we introduce WinoGrande, a large-scale dataset of 44k problems, inspired by the original WSC, but adjusted to improve both the scale and the hardness of the dataset. The key steps of the dataset construction consist of (1) large-scale crowdsourcing, followed by (2) systematic bias reduction using a novel AFLITE algorithm that generalizes human-detectable               word associations               to machine-detectable               embedding associations.               Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art models achieve considerably lower accuracy (59.4\%-79.1\%) on WINOGRANDE compared to humans (94\%), confirming that the high performance on the original WSC was inflated by spurious biases in the dataset.                          Furthermore, we report new state-of-the-art results on five related benchmarks with emphasis on their dual implications. On the one hand, they demonstrate the effectiveness of WINOGRANDE when used as a resource for transfer learning. On the other hand, the high performance on all these benchmarks suggests the extent to which spurious biases are prevalent in all such datasets, which motivates further research on algorithmic bias reduction.},

Furthermore, it can learn to do this in a remarkably short period of time (8 or 10 hours of machine-playing time) when given only the rules of the game, a sense of direction, and a redundant and incomplete list of parameters which are thought to have something to do with the game, but whose correct signs and relative weights are unknown and unspecified.

  abstract = {I apply recent work on "learning to think" (2015) and on PowerPlay (2011) to the incremental training of an increasingly general problem solver, continually learning to solve new tasks without forgetting previous skills. The problem solver is a single recurrent neural network (or similar general purpose computer) called ONE. ONE is unusual in the sense that it is trained in various ways, e.g., by black box optimization / reinforcement learning / artificial evolution as well as supervised / unsupervised learning. For example, ONE may learn through neuroevolution to control a robot through environment-changing actions, and learn through unsupervised gradient descent to predict future inputs and vector-valued reward signals as suggested in 1990. User-given tasks can be defined through extra goal-defining input patterns, also proposed in 1990. Suppose ONE has already learned many skills. Now a copy of ONE can be re-trained to learn a new skill, e.g., through neuroevolution without a teacher. Here it may profit from re-using previously learned subroutines, but it may also forget previous skills. Then ONE is retrained in PowerPlay style (2011) on stored input/output traces of (a) ONE's copy executing the new skill and (b) previous instances of ONE whose skills are still considered worth memorizing. Simultaneously, ONE is retrained on old traces (even those of unsuccessful trials) to become a better predictor, without additional expensive interaction with the enviroment. More and more control and prediction skills are thus collapsed into ONE, like in the chunker-automatizer system of the neural history compressor (1991). This forces ONE to relate partially analogous skills (with shared algorithmic information) to each other, creating common subroutines in form of shared subnetworks of ONE, to greatly speed up subsequent learning of additional, novel but algorithmically related skills.},

  abstract = {Rumelhart and McClelland's chapter about learning the past tense created a degree of controversy extraordinary even in the adversarial culture of modern science. It also stimulated a vast amount of research that advanced the understanding of the past tense, inflectional morphology in English and other languages, the nature of linguistic representations, relations between language and other phenomena such as reading and object recognition, the properties of artificial neural networks, and other topics. We examine the impact of the Rumelhart and McClelland model with the benefit of 25 years of hindsight. It is not clear who ``won'' the debate. It is clear, however, that the core ideas that the model instantiated have been assimilated into many areas in the study of language, changing the focus of research from abstract characterizations of linguistic competence to an emphasis on the role of the statistical structure of language in acquisition and processing.},

  abstract = {How deep learning---from Google Translate to driverless cars to personal cognitive assistants---is changing our lives and transforming every sector of the economy.The deep learning revolution has brought us driverless cars, the greatly improved Google Translate, fluent conversations with Siri and Alexa, and enormous profits from automated trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Deep learning networks can play poker better than professional poker players and defeat a world champion at Go. In this book, Terry Sejnowski explains how deep learning went from being an arcane academic field to a disruptive technology in the information economy.Sejnowski played an important role in the founding of deep learning, as one of a small group of researchers in the 1980s who challenged the prevailing logic-and-symbol based version of AI. The new version of AI Sejnowski and others developed, which became deep learning, is fueled instead by data. Deep networks learn from data in the same way that babies experience the world, starting with fresh eyes and gradually acquiring the skills needed to navigate novel environments. Learning algorithms extract information from raw data; information can be used to create knowledge; knowledge underlies understanding; understanding leads to wisdom. Someday a driverless car will know the road better than you do and drive with more skill; a deep learning network will diagnose your illness; a personal cognitive assistant will augment your puny human brain. It took nature many millions of years to evolve human intelligence; AI is on a trajectory measured in decades. Sejnowski prepares us for a deep learning future.},

  abstract = {Crackling noise arises when a system responds to changing external conditions through discrete, impulsive events spanning a broad range of sizes. A wide variety of physical systems exhibiting crackling noise have been studied, from earthquakes on faults to paper crumpling. Because these systems exhibit regular behaviour over a huge range of sizes, their behaviour is likely to be independent of microscopic and macroscopic details, and progress can be made by the use of simple models. The fact that these models and real systems can share the same behaviour on many scales is called universality. We illustrate these ideas by using results for our model of crackling noise in magnets, explaining the use of the renormalization group and scaling collapses, and we highlight some continuing challenges in this still-evolving field.},

  abstract = {The capacity of a neural network to absorb information is limited by its number of parameters. Conditional computation, where parts of the network are active on a per-example basis, has been proposed in theory as a way of dramatically increasing model capacity without a proportional increase in computation. In practice, however, there are significant algorithmic and performance challenges. In this work, we address these challenges and finally realize the promise of conditional computation, achieving greater than 1000x improvements in model capacity with only minor losses in computational efficiency on modern GPU clusters. We introduce a Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts layer (MoE), consisting of up to thousands of feed-forward sub-networks. A trainable gating network determines a sparse combination of these experts to use for each example. We apply the MoE to the tasks of language modeling and machine translation, where model capacity is critical for absorbing the vast quantities of knowledge available in the training corpora. We present model architectures in which a MoE with up to 137 billion parameters is applied convolutionally between stacked LSTM layers. On large language modeling and machine translation benchmarks, these models achieve significantly better results than state-of-the-art at lower computational cost.},

  abstract = {Elucidating determinants of interspecies variation in brain size has been a long-standing challenge in cognitive and evolutionary ecology. As the brain is an energetically expensive organ, energetic tradeoffs among organs are considered to play a key role in brain size evolution. This study examined the tradeoff between the brain and locomotion in birds by testing the relationship between brain size, flight modes with different energetic costs (flapping and soaring), and migratory behavior, using published data on the whole-brain mass of 2242 species. According to comparative analyses considering phylogeny and body mass, soarers, who can gain kinetic energy from wind shear or thermals and consequently save flight costs, have larger brains than flappers among migratory birds. Meanwhile, the brain size difference was not consistent in residents, and the size variation appeared much larger than that in migrants. In addition, the brain size of migratory birds was smaller than that of resident birds among flappers, whereas this property was not significant in soarers. Although further research is needed to draw a definitive conclusion, these findings provide further support for the energetic tradeoff of the brain with flight and migratory movements in birds and advance the idea that a locomotion mode with lower energetic cost could be a driver of encephalization during the evolution of the brain.},

In this paper, we generalize this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve superhuman performance in many challenging games. Starting from random play and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero convincingly defeated a world champion program in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess), as well as Go.},

Exploring the commonalities of artificial systems, including economic systems, the business firm, artificial intelligence, complex engineering projects, and social plans, Simon argues that designed systems are a valid field of study, and he proposes a science of design. For this third edition, originally published in 1996, Simon added new material that takes into account advances in cognitive psychology and the science of design while confirming and extending the book's basic thesis: that a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for intelligent action.Simon won the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1978 for his research into the decision-making process within economic organizations and the Turing Award (considered by some the computer science equivalent to the Nobel) with Allen Newell in 1975 for contributions to artificial intelligence, the psychology of human cognition, and list processing. The Sciences of the Artificial distills the essence of Simon's thought accessibly and coherently. This reissue of the third edition makes a pioneering work available to a new audience.},

  abstract = {A long history of analogy making between neoclassical economics and physical thermodynamics has unfortunately served to obscure two important relations between the two fields: their definitions of equilibria stem from essentially the same three axioms for the mathematical representations of systems, while the classes of transformation each has chosen to emphasize, and their responses to the problem of path dependence, have led them to very different interpretations of duality in those representations. Despite these conventional differences, we show that economies in which all agents have preferences quasi-linear in some good have a trading-constraint structure isomorphic to the structure of physical systems with classical thermodynamic equations of state. Exact equivalents of thermodynamic potentials, including entropy, can be constructed, and function as the economic counterparts to free energies. Quasi-linear economies are the most general in which the Walrasian idea of price formation as an analog of force balance can be realized. More general economic models raise the same methodological problems as more complex physical models that exhibit path-dependence. We show how the degree of aggregatability of an economic model corresponds to which properties of equilibria retain path-independence, and to the extent to which a social-welfare function exists. A new contour money-metric utility defines the maximal generalization of social-welfare functions in arbitrary economies, but depends on the endowments and composition of the economy in non-quasi-linear cases, and is limited to one-dimensional contours of equilibria in non-aggregatable cases. The differences between economic and thermodynamic methodology lies in the economic focus on the irreversible movement from initial disequilibrium endowments to equilibrium through voluntary trade, in contrast to the thermodynamic recognition that only reversible transformations lead to measurement of system structure. The consequences of respecting reversibility for economic method are sketched, and alternative interpretations of the Walrasian notion of wealth preservation are presented.},

This Arrow-Debreu model (known for two of its most prominent founders, both Nobel Laureates) is the basis of modern price theory and of a wide range of applications. The text starts with elementary models: Robinson Crusoe, the Edgeworth Box, and a 2-commodity 2-household 2-firm model. It gives a brief introduction to the mathematics used in the field (continuity, convexity, separation theorems, Brouwer fixed-point theorem, point-to-set mappings, and Shapley-Folkman theorem). It then presents the mathematical general equilibrium model in progressively more general settings, including point-valued, set-valued, and nonconvex set-valued demand and supply. Existence of general equilibrium, fundamental theorems of welfare economics, core convergence, and futures markets with time and uncertainty are treated fully. The new edition updates discussion throughout and expands the number and variety of exercises. It offers a revised and extended treatment of core convergence, including the case of non-convex preferences, and introduces the investigation of approximate equilibrium with U-shaped curves and non-convex preferences.},

For self-dual spin or gauge systems this transformation is shown to be differentiably conjugate to another one, which is obtained as a high-temperature approximation. The conjugation relation is established through the duality mapping. This explains the mechanism leading to some exact results obtained with Migdal's differential renormalization equation. The last equation is also explicitly rederived as the result of potential-moving approximations inspired by the methods of differential renormalization in real space. Some applications and extensions of the above results are finally considered in connection with an approach, which was recently proposed for systematically improving Migdal's approximation.}

  abstract = {Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs---30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers---a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

It is generally interpreted that these changes are due to dispersion/aggregation of pigment-containing organelles within dermal chromatophores. Here, combining microscopy, photometric videography and photonic band-gap modelling, we show that chameleons shift colour through active tuning of a lattice of guanine nanocrystals within a superficial thick layer of dermal iridophores. In addition, we show that a deeper population of iridophores with larger crystals reflects a substantial proportion of sunlight especially in the near-infrared range. The organization of iridophores into two superposed layers constitutes an evolutionary novelty for chameleons, which allows some species to combine efficient camouflage with spectacular display, while potentially providing passive thermal protection.},

  abstract = {Evolution through natural selection has been going on for a very long time. Evolution through artificial selection has been practiced by humans for a large part of our history, in the breeding of plants and livestock. Artificial evolution, where we evolve an artifact through artificial selection, has been around since electronic computers became common: about 30 years. Right from the beginning, people have suggested using artificial evolution to design electronics automatically.l Only recently, though, have suitable re\- configurable silicon chips become available that make it easy for artificial evolution to work with a real, physical, electronic medium: before them, ex\- periments had to be done entirely in software simulations. Early research concentrated on the potential applications opened-up by the raw speed ad\- vantage of dedicated digital hardware over software simulation on a general\- purpose computer. This book is an attempt to show that there is more to it than that. In fact, a radically new viewpoint is possible, with fascinating consequences. This book was written as a doctoral thesis, submitted in September 1996. As such, it was a rather daring exercise in ruthless brevity. Believing that the contribution I had to make was essentially a simple one, I resisted being drawn into peripheral discussions. In the places where I deliberately drop a subject, this implies neither that it's not interesting, nor that it's not relevant: just that it's not a crucial part of the tale I want to tell here.},

  abstract = {The habitual consumption of large-animal resources (e.g., similar sized or larger than the consumer) separates human and nonhuman primate behavior. Flaked stone tool use, another important hominin behavior, is often portrayed as being functionally related to this by the necessity of a sharp edge for cutting animal tissue. However, most research on both issues emphasizes sites that postdate ca. 2.0 million years ago. This paper critically examines the theoretical significance of the earlier origins of these two behaviors, their proposed interrelationship, and the nature of the empirical record. We argue that concepts of meat-eating and tool use are too loosely defined: outside-bone nutrients (e.g., meat) and inside-bone nutrients (e.g., marrow and brains) have different macronutrient characteristics (protein vs. fat), mechanical requirements for access (cutting vs. percussion), search, handling and competitive costs, encounter rates, and net returns. Thus, they would have demanded distinct technological and behavioral solutions. We propose that the regular exploitation of large-animal resources---the ``human predatory pattern''---began with an emphasis on percussion-based scavenging of inside-bone nutrients, independent of the emergence of flaked stone tool use. This leads to a series of empirical test implications that differ from previous ``meat-eating'' origins scenarios.},

  abstract = {We derive an inequality that the parameters of a 1D free-particle Gaussian wave packet with a positive group velocity, approaching a given region x\,\&gt;\,q, must satisfy such that a negative probability current J exists on q. Local probability conservation implies the counter-intuitive result that the particle detection probability in the region x\,\&gt;\,q is actually decreasing. The condition J\,\&lt;\,0 requires the negative correlation of the position and momentum observables of the state, but the time scales for the negative current and anti-correlation regimes are not identical. Using a probability current operator, we obtain an integral representation of J in momentum space for any free particle wave packet. We use this integral representation to distinguish the separate contributions to J by the positive and negative momentum components, and we identify a third contribution to J composed of cross-terms of both momenta. For the specific case of a Gaussian wave packet with a negative correlation between its position and momentum, the positive momentum component can contribute a negative value to the probability current.}

To get from one theory to the other, we know that Einstein relied on a certain number of fundamental concepts, such as the equivalence principle, and a few key mathematical techniques, for instance, the absolute tensor calculus of Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi Civita. Einstein also had need of a third theory and technique, elaborated by his former mathematics professor, Hermann Minkowski (1864-1909), although he did not recognize this for several years. In this paper, we examine the fortunes of Minkowski ` s space-time theory from 1908 to 1916. Our focus is on the emergence of Minkowski `s four-dimensional formalism as a standard technique in theoretical physics, and we investigate one aspect of this history in some detail: the reformulation and reinterpretation of the laws of special relativity in the language of non-Euclidean geometry. The related work done on the space-time theory, or what we call the `non-Euclidean style ` of Minkowskian relativity, provides an example of the geometrization of physics brought about by Minkowski and his followers.},

  abstract = {Since the discovery of polymorphism in 1832, the ability of molecular crystals to adopt different crystal forms has intrigued and frustrated the scientific community. Control of this property has been limited by poor understanding of nucleation pathways and the absence of methods that can intercept crystallization at its earliest stages. Nonetheless, polymorphism, a favorite subject of Jack Dunitz, who is honored in this special issue, has opened a window into the forces that govern molecular organization in the solid state, while enabling discovery of new crystal forms with improved properties. This review illustrates the growth of crystals in nanoscale reactors with sizes comparable with those for nucleation, where thermodynamics and kinetics intersect, changing polymorph stabilities, providing insights into nucleation, enabling discovery of new polymorphs, and even suggesting a route to disappearing polymorphs, brought to our attention by Dunitz and Bernstein twenty years ago.},

  abstract = {Introduced by the late Per Bak and his colleagues, self-organized criticality (SOC) has been one of the most stimulating concepts to come out of statistical mechanics and condensed matter theory in the last few decades, and has played a significant role in the development of complexity science. SOC, and more generally fractals and power laws, have attracted much comment, ranging from the very positive to the polemical. The other papers (Aschwanden et~al. in Space Sci. Rev., 2014, this issue; McAteer et~al. in Space Sci. Rev., 2015, this issue; Sharma et~al. in Space Sci. Rev. 2015, in preparation) in this special issue showcase the considerable body of observations in solar, magnetospheric and fusion plasma inspired by the SOC~idea, and expose the fertile role the new paradigm has played in approaches to modeling and understanding multiscale plasma instabilities. This very broad impact, and the necessary process of adapting a scientific hypothesis to the conditions of a given physical system, has meant that SOC as studied in these fields has sometimes differed significantly from the definition originally given by its creators. In Bak's own field of theoretical physics there are significant observational and theoretical open questions, even 25 years on (Pruessner 2012). One aim of the present review is to address the dichotomy between the great reception SOC has received in some areas, and its shortcomings, as they became manifest in the controversies it triggered. Our article tries to clear up what we think are misunderstandings of SOC in fields more remote from its origins in statistical mechanics, condensed matter and dynamical systems by revisiting Bak, Tang and Wiesenfeld's original papers.},

  abstract = {We consider one-dimensional classical time-dependent Hamiltonian systems with quasi-periodic orbits. It is well known that such systems possess an adiabatic invariant which coincides with the action variable of the Hamiltonian formalism. We present a new proof of the adiabatic invariance of this quantity and illustrate our arguments by means of explicit calculations for the harmonic oscillator. The new proof makes essential use of the Hamiltonian formalism. The key step is the introduction of a slowly varying quantity closely related to the action variable. This new quantity arises naturally within the Hamiltonian framework as follows: a canonical transformation is first performed to convert the system to action-angle coordinates; then the new quantity is constructed as an action integral (effectively a new action variable) using the new coordinates. The integration required for this construction provides, in a natural way, the averaging procedure introduced in other proofs, though here it is an average in phase space rather than over time.},

It reviews empirical results which fit the theory, and suggests important new directions for research, within the scope of NSF's recent initiative on Cognitive Optimization and Prediction. The appendices suggest possible connections to the realms of human subjective experience, comparative cognitive neuroscience, and new challenges in electric power. The major challenge before us today in mathematical neural networks is to replicate the ``mouse level'', but the paper does contain a few thoughts about building, understanding and nourishing levels of general intelligence beyond the mouse.},

SRMs infer continuous representations on a set of unobserved variables, given observations on observed variables. Current generative models on spatial domains, such as diffusion and flow matching models, often collapse to hallucination in case of complex distributions. To measure this, we introduce a set of benchmark tasks that test the quality of complex reasoning in generative models and can quantify hallucination. The SRM framework allows to report key findings about importance of sequentialization in generation, the associated order, as well as the sampling strategies during training. It demonstrates, for the first time, that order of generation can successfully be predicted by the denoising network itself. Using these findings, we can increase the accuracy of specific reasoning tasks from {$<$}1\% to {$>$}50\%.},

  abstract = {The new and rapidly growing field of communication sciences owes as much to Norbert Wiener as to any one man. He coined the word for it---cybernetics. In God \& Golem, Inc., the author concerned himself with major points in cybernetics which are relevant to religious issues.The first point he considers is that of the machine which learns. While learning is a property almost exclusively ascribed to the self-conscious living system, a computer now exists which not only can be programmed to play a game of checkers, but one which can "learn" from its past experience and improve on its own game. For a time, the machine was able to beat its inventor at checkers. "It did win," writes the author, "and it did learn to win; and the method of its learning was no different in principle from that of the human being who learns to play checkers.A second point concerns machines which have the capacity to reproduce themselves. It is our commonly held belief that God made man in his own image. The propagation of the race may also be interpreted as a function in which one living being makes another in its own image. But the author demonstrates that man has made machines which are "very well able to make other machines in their own image," and these machine images are not merely pictorial representations but operative images. Can we then say: God is to Golem as man is to Machines? in Jewish legend, golem is an embryo Adam, shapeless and not fully created, hence a monster, an automation.The third point considered is that of the relation between man and machine. The concern here is ethical. "render unto man the things which are man's and unto the computer the things which are the computer's," warns the author. In this section of the book, Dr. Wiener considers systems involving elements of man and machine. The book is written for the intellectually alert public and does not involve any highly technical knowledge. It is based on lectures given at Yale, at the Soci{\'e}t{\'e} Philosophique de Royaumont, and elsewhere.},

One the one hand, I have recorded the random shot effect as a suitable input for testing nonlinear circuits. On the other hand, for some of the work that Professor W. A. Rosenblith and I have been doing concerning the nature of the electroencephalogram, and in particular of the alpha rhythm, it has occurred to me to use the model of a system of random nonlinear oscillators excited by a random input.... At the beginning we had contemplated a series of only four or five lectures. My ideas developed pari passu with the course, and by the end of the term we found ourselves with a set of fifteen lectures. The last few of these were devoted to the application of my ideas to problems in the statistical mechanics of gases. This work is both new and tentative, and I found that I had to supplement my course by the writing over of these with the help of Professer Y. W. Lee.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a computer system for understanding English. The system answers questions, executes commands, and accepts information in an interactive English dialog. It is based on the belief that in modeling language understanding, we must deal in an integrated way with all of the aspects of language---syntax, semantics, and inference. The system contains a parser, a recognition grammar of English, programs for semantic analysis, and a general problem solving system. We assume that a computer cannot deal reasonably with language unless it can understand the subject it is discussing. Therefore, the program is given a detailed model of a particular domain. In addition, the system has a simple model of its own mentality. It can remember and discuss its plans and actions as well as carrying them out. It enters into a dialog with a person, responding to English sentences with actions and English replies, asking for clarification when its heuristic programs cannot understand a sentence through the use of syntactic, semantic, contextual, and physical knowledge. Knowledge in the system is represented in the form of procedures, rather than tables of rules or lists of patterns. By developing special procedural representations for syntax, semantics, and inference, we gain flexibility and power. Since each piece of knowledge can be a procedure, it can call directly on any other piece of knowledge in the system.},

We propose a reconstruction that is accurate enough to serve as a replacement for the MNIST dataset, with insignificant changes in accuracy.  We trace each MNIST digit to its NIST source and its rich metadata such as writer identifier, partition identifier, etc. We also reconstruct the complete MNIST test set with 60,000 samples instead of the usual 10,000. Since the balance 50,000 were never distributed, they enable us to investigate the impact of twenty-five years of MNIST experiments on the reported testing performances. Our results unambiguously confirm the trends observed by {\textbackslash}citet\{recht2018cifar,recht2019imagenet\}: although the misclassification rates are slightly off, classifier ordering and model selection remain broadly reliable. We attribute this phenomenon to the pairing benefits of comparing classifiers on the same digits.},

A fast scaling law implies that one can solve machine learning problems by simply boosting the data and the model sizes. Yet, in many cases, the benefit of adding more data can be negligible. In this work, we study the rate of scaling laws of nearest neighbor classifiers. We show that a scaling law can have two phases: in the first phase, the generalization error depends polynomially on the data dimension and decreases fast; whereas in the second phase, the error depends exponentially on the data dimension and decreases slowly. Our analysis highlights the complexity of the data distribution in determining the generalization error. When the data distributes benignly, our result suggests that nearest neighbor classifier can achieve a generalization error that depends polynomially, instead of exponentially, on the data dimension.},

Like Uhlenbeck et al., Wiener and Bigelow employed the language of communication engineering and used the notion of noise to characterize the ambient factors that caused errors, fluctuations, and deviations in technological systems. The originality of Wiener and Bigelow's approach was a new way to treat such noise. They aimed to reproduce the enemy target trajectory polluted by random noise in observing and tracking devices, i.e. a prediction problem. Wiener's optimum predictor was later known as the ``Wiener filter,'' which utilized statistical properties of signal and noise---especially their correlation functions---to minimize the latter. In so doing, Wiener turned noise into unwanted waveforms that could be manipulated and filtered through generalized harmonic analysis.},

  abstract = {Wigner's quasi-probability distribution function in phase-space is a special (Weyl) representation of the density matrix. It has been useful in describing quantum transport in quantum optics; nuclear physics; decoherence (eg, quantum computing); quantum chaos; "Welcher Weg" discussions; semiclassical limits. It is also of importance in signal processing. Nevertheless, a remarkable aspect of its internal logic, pioneered by Moyal, has only emerged in the last quarter-century: It furnishes a third, alternative, formulation of Quantum Mechanics, independent of the conventional Hilbert Space, or Path Integral formulations. In this logically complete and self-standing formulation, one need not choose sides--coordinate or momentum space. It works in full phase-space, accommodating the uncertainty principle. This is an introductory overview of the formulation with simple illustrations.},

  abstract = {An exceptionally accessible introduction to quantum field theoryQuantum field theory is by far the most spectacularly successful theory in physics, but also one of the most mystifying. Quantum Field Theory, as Simply as Possible provides an essential primer on the subject, giving readers the conceptual foundations they need to wrap their heads around one of the most important yet baffling subjects in physics.Quantum field theory grew out of quantum mechanics in the late 1930s and was developed by a generation of brilliant young theorists, including Julian Schwinger and Richard Feynman. Their predictions were experimentally verified to an astounding accuracy unmatched by the rest of physics. Quantum field theory unifies quantum mechanics and special relativity, thus providing the framework for understanding the quantum mysteries of the subatomic world. With his trademark blend of wit and physical insight, A. Zee guides readers from the classical notion of the field to the modern frontiers of quantum field theory, covering a host of topics along the way, including antimatter, Feynman diagrams, virtual particles, the path integral, quantum chromodynamics, electroweak unification, grand unification, and quantum gravity.A unique and valuable introduction for students and general readers alike, Quantum Field Theory, as Simply as Possible explains how quantum field theory informs our understanding of the universe, and how it can shed light on some of the deepest mysteries of physics.},

  abstract = {Scale has opened new frontiers in natural language processing -- but at a high cost. In response, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and Switch Transformers have been proposed as an energy efficient path to even larger and more capable language models. But advancing the state-of-the-art across a broad set of natural language tasks has been hindered by training instabilities and uncertain quality during fine-tuning. Our work focuses on these issues and acts as a design guide. We conclude by scaling a sparse model to 269B parameters, with a computational cost comparable to a 32B dense encoder-decoder Transformer (Stable and Transferable Mixture-of-Experts or ST-MoE-32B). For the first time, a sparse model achieves state-of-the-art performance in transfer learning, across a diverse set of tasks including reasoning (SuperGLUE, ARC Easy, ARC Challenge), summarization (XSum, CNN-DM), closed book question answering (WebQA, Natural Questions), and adversarially constructed tasks (Winogrande, ANLI R3).},

Also we present a probabilistic algorithm for generation of finite ultrametric structures of any topology in high-dimensional Euclidean space. Validity of the algorithm is demonstrated by explicit calculations of distance matrices and ultrametricity indexes for various dimensions n.},

  abstract = {Animals often exhibit intriguing and captivating patterns of behavior, from migration and homing, to communication. But how is this behavior controlled? Behavioral Neurobiology introduces undergraduate students and other readers to the fascinating field of neuroethology - the study of the neurobiological processes underlying animal behavior. Written in a lively, easy to read style, it examines the key concepts and ideas which underpin this intricate and elegant subject, and describes many of the ground-breaking discoveries that have helped us to unravel the mechanisms behind the behaviors we can observe.Beginning with a look at the history of the study of behavior, from Aristotle to recent breakthroughs and predictions for the future, the book then reviews the ethological and neurobiological concepts that constitute the essential tools of behavioral neurobiology, before moving on to the field of neuroethology itself. In each chapter, the text not only describes the major findings in each area, but also the methods used to obtain these results.Behavioral Neurobiology has the following accompanying online resources:For students:DT Multiple choice questions for you to test yourselfDT Useful weblinksDT A biography of the author and interview about key questions in behavioral neurobiologyFor lecturers:DT Answers to the questions provided at the end of each chapterDT Figures from the book in a downloadable formatDT Journal Club material for each chapter},

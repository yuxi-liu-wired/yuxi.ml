# Trillion Credit Squadron Winners

This summer, the first of GDW's Trillion Credit Squadron tournaments were held, 
drawing about thirty entrants each. These tournaments were held at Origins, in 
San Mateo California, GenCon East, in Cherry Hill New Jersey, and Gen-Con XIV, 
near Kenosha Wisconsin. The Winner at Origins was Doug Lenat, of Los Altos, 
California. The winner at Gen-Con East was Martin Misciagna, of Brooklyn, New 
York. The winner at Gen-Con XIV was Mike Moline, of St. Cloud, Minnesota. Doug 
Lenat's fleet was the most unique, and since space consideration prohibit us 
printing them all, we decided that Doug's fleet would be of the most interest 
to the readers of the Journal. Doug's fleet consisted of ninety-six ships and 
cost MCr998,642.
